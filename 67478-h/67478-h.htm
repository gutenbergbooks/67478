<h2 class="nobreak">Introduction</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Those</span> who have read &#8220;A United States
Midshipman Afloat&#8221; will recall that Philip
Perry and his friend, Sydney Monroe, recent
graduates of the Naval Academy at Annapolis,
had been but a short time in the
regular naval service when the battle-ship
&#8220;Connecticut,&#8221; to which they had been
assigned, was ordered to a South American
port. Here they found a revolution in
progress, and it became the duty of the
young men to prevent the delivery of certain
machine guns and other war material which
had been shipped from America to the insurgents.
In this they were successful after
some stirring adventure on land and sea.</p>

<p>The present book shows the same young
officers on a United States gunboat in the
Yangtse River at a time when the lives of
foreigners in China are in peril. A further
account of their experiences in Eastern waters
will be found in &#8220;A United States Midshipman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
in the Philippines.&#8221; In all of these
books the endeavor has been to portray some
of the bold enterprises which are all in the
day&#8217;s work for a naval officer, and to show
how our modern navy accomplishes big things
in a quiet way.</p>

<small>AN INCIDENT OF THE RIVER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> United States gunboat &#8220;Ph&#339;nix&#8221; lay
at anchor in the swift current of the Yangtse
River opposite the Chinese city of Ku-Ling.
The surface of the water seemed tranquil, but
a closer look over the side of the ship showed
to the observer the strength of the muddy
flood that swept for thousands of miles
through the length of the Chinese Empire,
from the far-away snows of the mountains of
Tibet onward to the waters of the Pacific
Ocean.</p>

<p>Two young midshipmen were standing at
the gunboat&#8217;s rail in eager conversation.
Their eyes were intent upon the scenes on the
shore scarce a hundred yards away.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>&#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s Langdon!&#8221; exclaimed Philip
Perry, the taller of the two lads, as the form
of the government pilot, Joseph Langdon,
was seen coming from the ward-room companion
ladder. &#8220;Langdon, have you ever seen
this much talked about Chang-Li-Hun?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seen him?&#8221; Langdon echoed, approaching
the speaker. &#8220;I&#8217;ve talked with him many a
time, and you can take my word for it, there
isn&#8217;t a man in all China whom I wouldn&#8217;t
sooner have for my enemy. He&#8217;s a past
craftsman in oriental subtlety and diplomacy.
He rules his own people with a rod of iron,
and if an official displeases him, off goes his
head in the most approved Chinese fashion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both midshipmen suppressed an unconscious
shiver as the American pilot of the
Yangtse River illustrated the death of the
disgraced official by chopping at his own thick
neck with a great sun-tanned, muscular hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything looks peaceful enough ashore
there now, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221; Sydney Monroe,
Phil&#8217;s friend and classmate, said in a tone of
inquiry. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem as if the foreigners
were much in fear of the dangers of Chinese
violence. Look!&#8221; he exclaimed; &#8220;there are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
European women and even children walking
along the streets.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the danger in China,&#8221; Langdon returned
in a troubled voice. &#8220;Living in this
country is like being on top of a presumably
extinct volcano. No one knows when it will
break out. Sometimes it comes without the
usual rumblings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There must have been some rumblings,&#8221;
Philip Perry exclaimed, pointing suggestively
at the half score of foreign gunboats representing
all the European navies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Langdon answered, &#8220;there have
been many signs which have greatly alarmed
those who have made a study of the Chinese
situation. This viceroy has within the last
few weeks allowed many insults by his people
to foreigners to go unpunished, and will not
listen to the appeals of the foreign consuls.
The missionaries all over the provinces are in
fear of some terrible calamity, and it is
through their urgent demands that these war-ships
are here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do the foreigners fear?&#8221; Sydney
asked, interestedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fear!&#8221; Langdon exclaimed. &#8220;Why, almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
every kind of torture and death. When once
the Chinese are allowed to avenge themselves
upon the foreigner there&#8217;s no limit to their
cruelty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t we appeal to the Chinese
government at Peking to protect foreigners?&#8221;
Phil asked gravely. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t we a treaty
with China for protection of United States
citizens here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Langdon gave the lad a withering look, as
he replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;This viceroy is not letting Peking know
what is happening in his provinces. If he
succeeds in making the country over which
he rules dangerous and unprofitable to
foreigners without doing more than kill a few
missionaries and ruining foreign trade,
Peking will apologize for the deaths and pay
an indemnity to the families of those killed
and then to sustain him in the eyes of his
people decorate him with the Order of the
Dragon. But if he goes too far, then Peking,
in order to save herself from an invasion of
foreign soldiers, will disgrace the viceroy in
one of the many ways known best to the
Chinese.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>&#8220;Here comes the captain now,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed
as a small white canopied steam
launch shoved off from the jetty and stood
toward the &#8220;Ph&#339;nix.&#8221;</p>

<p>All three walked toward the gangway to
meet Commander Hughes, the captain of the
gunboat, who had been ashore to visit his
consul and gather the latest news of the much
feared uprising among the fanatical natives.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Webster,&#8221; Commander Hughes exclaimed
in hearty tones to the executive
officer, as he put his foot on the quarter-deck,
returning in a precise manner the salutes of
the officers standing near. &#8220;Keep your guard
for the mission ready to land at a moment&#8217;s
notice. I saw that half-breed Emmons, the
oracle of the river. He is non-committal, but
I can see he fears trouble. He promised to
warn me in plenty of time. Emmons says
that the Tartar general, commanding all the
soldiers under the viceroy, is not in sympathy
with this movement, and if he can urge the
viceroy to take steps to suppress it, our
presence here may yet be unnecessary.&#8221;</p>

<p>After the captain had entered his cabin the
two midshipmen turned eagerly upon the pilot.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>&#8220;Who is this half-breed Emmons the
captain speaks of?&#8221; Phil demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see all those launches over there?&#8221;
the pilot inquired, pointing to the near-by
docks where many small vessels were unloading.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, they belong to Emmons,&#8221; he added,
&#8220;and he&#8217;s very rich. His mother was a
native woman and his father an American
merchant skipper. Emmons wears Chinese
clothes and to meet him on the street you&#8217;d
take him for a native. We&#8217;re lucky to have
Emmons with us, but if the viceroy suspects
that he is, he&#8217;d enjoy nothing better than to
confiscate his property and expel him from
the provinces, even if he doesn&#8217;t have him
executed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s this mission?&#8221; Sydney asked gazing
searchingly out over the green sloped
hills of the country.</p>

<p>Langdon held a pointing finger steadily
out to the right of the walled Chinese city.</p>

<p>&#8220;About five miles from here,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;It&#8217;s built in the middle of an ancient
Chinese graveyard and is a thorn in the
side of the Chinese. It was erected three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
years ago, and by order of this same viceroy.
No other site could be used. He knew that
the Chinese would never rest until they tore
the building down. It took nearly two years
to build; all the work was done by Christian
converts. I don&#8217;t blame the captain for
feeling uneasy, for in my opinion that mission
will be the first point of attack.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil and Sydney were soon after below in
their rooms finishing their unpacking; for
they had but recently arrived on the station
and had joined the gunboat just previous to
her leaving Shanghai on her four-hundred
mile cruise up the great Chinese river. So
interested were they during the day, viewing
the shifting scenery, and at night so much of
their time had been occupied in standing
watch on the gunboat&#8217;s bridge, that they had
quite forgotten their trunks as yet unpacked
in the ward-room passages.</p>

<p>After dinner that evening, while the midshipmen
were enjoying the bracing fall air
on the quarter-deck, Phil was suddenly
summoned to report immediately to the
captain.</p>

<p>Receiving Commander Hughes&#8217; instructions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
to take the steam launch and board
each of the foreign gunboats, the midshipman
left the cabin to carry out his orders,
much elated at the exalted r&ocirc;le he was playing
in the affairs of nations. About an hour
later, having visited each of the foreign gunboats
and given to their commanding officers
his captain&#8217;s letters, the launch breasted the
swift current of the river on her return to the
ship. The coxswain of the launch was steering
his boat close to the hulls of the junks
moored to the jetty, in order to avoid the
strength of the current. The river was silent;
no sound could be heard save the whir of the
tiny engine and the rush of the tide against
the sides of the launch.</p>

<p>As the boat passed within the shadow of a
high-sided junk, such as are used by the
wealthy Chinese as house-boats, a piercing
cry rang out over the quiet water from her
deck, directly above Phil&#8217;s head; then he
heard the sound of a scuffle, followed by the
splash of a heavy body in the dark waters
astern of the launch. The lad was on his
feet in an instant; throwing off his coat, he
sprang out on the launch&#8217;s rail, ready to go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
to the assistance of the unfortunate one who
had been swallowed up in the treacherous
waters. The coxswain had by signal stopped
the headway of the launch and all eyes were
searching the waters astern: the ripples that
closed over the body were visible, while some
yards down stream an object floated, all but
submerged, rapidly borne away by the hurrying
flood.</p>

<p>The lad stood irresolute for the fraction
of a second, fear of the treacherous flood tugging
at his heart; then overcoming this momentary
weakness, he turned to the coxswain
beside him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Go down to leeward and pick me up,&#8221; he
ordered, gathering himself together and
springing far out into the dark river.</p>

<p>As he struck out boldly sinister stories of
the enchanted water surged back to him. He
had heard how the suction from the muddy
bottom was known to drag to their death even
the strongest swimmers: men who had
missed their footing while stepping into boats
alongside their own ships had disappeared
beneath the yellow surface never to rise again.
The Chinese superstition was that a dragon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
lived in the river and that all persons who
fell into his home were drawn to the bottom
and devoured by the monster.</p>

<p>Phil struggled manfully against these weird
fancies, yet he was conscious of the force acting
to suck his body down while he exerted
all his strength to keep his head above the
engulfing waters. The high-sided junks
flashed by him as he swam with the current
toward the victim struggling despairingly in
the embrace of the river dragon. In a few
moments his strong strokes had brought him
alongside the drowning man. He grasped
the man&#8217;s clothing and drew him closer, seeking
a firmer hold. Avoiding the waving
arms, Phil&#8217;s hand worked its way along the
body until it reached his head, and there his
fingers closed about the long braided cue;
twisting this around his hand, the lad swam
out toward the middle of the river. The
Chinaman struggled violently, striving to
grasp Phil&#8217;s hand. The boy saw with terror
that if the Chinaman succeeded they would
both drown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be still or I&#8217;ll let you go!&#8221; he commanded,
forgetting in his anxiety that he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
talking to a Chinaman, but nevertheless the
man quieted down and Phil&#8217;s hopes rose.</p>

<p>With the stinging water in his eyes, he
gazed about him for the launch; he could
scarcely see; the oppressive darkness seemed
to be closing in about him. Then out of the
night there loomed the sides of many junks,
massed in tiers, directly in the path of the
current carrying him. This new and terrible
danger filled him with despair: even the
strongest swimmer could not expect to survive
if he were drawn under that wooden
wall of vessels; if he were not crushed between
their huge hulls he would be forced
beneath the surface for so long a time that
life would be extinct before he rose again.
His one chance was to breast the tide, swimming
out from shore in the hope that thus he
might clear the outside junk.</p>

<p>The hulls seemed ever closer and the lad&#8217;s
efforts weaker. The Chinaman was a dead
weight upon him; if he abandoned the
man he could save himself. Would it not be
just? He could not hope to save both himself
and the Chinaman, therefore, was he not
obeying the first law of nature by abandoning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
the unfortunate man to his fate? But Phil,
even with death staring him in the face, dismissed
these unnerving thoughts from his
mind. He would save the man or drown in
the attempt! As he swam manfully ahead,
supporting the fully conscious but terrified
Chinaman, and casting anxious glances behind
him at the fast approaching menace,
his heart was gladdened at the sight of the
launch standing in boldly between him and
the junks, now but a few dozen yards away.
Then he saw the boat turn slowly, painfully,
toward him in the grasp of the cruel, relentless
current which seemed to sweep her down
under the yawning whirlpool. He closed his
eyes to shut out the sight. If the launch
failed to turn inside the distance she would
be swept under the mass of shipping and be
capsized; then the brave men who had fearlessly
taken this risk to save him would all
find a watery grave in the river.</p>

<p>&#8220;She can&#8217;t make it!&#8221; he gasped despairingly.</p>

<small>AN UNPLEASANT ENCOUNTER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil</span> had ceased to struggle; his doom was
too close upon him to hope to escape it. His
one chance was the launch. A low cry of
joy burst from him as he saw her turn safely
under the overhanging bows of the junks
and steam swiftly toward him. Yet he knew
that all danger had not passed; the current
was still sweeping him down while the boat
must keep her headway else she would be
carried back under the shipping. The launch
loomed above him; he saw her anxious crew
gathered in the bow ready to grasp the struggling
men as they were swept by on the crest
of the flood.</p>

<p>He was conscious of strong arms about
him, and the next moment he and the rescued
Chinaman were safely on board the launch,
while she was steaming at full speed for safety
away from the treacherous shore.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>After the rescued Chinaman had been
resuscitated, and Phil had recovered from his
terrible exertions, he ordered the coxswain to
land at the foreign concession. The Chinaman
lay on the deck of the launch, fully alive
but not showing by word or sign his gratitude
to the midshipman who had saved his life
at the risk of his own.</p>

<p>As the boat stopped at the stone steps of
the jetty, the Chinaman arose unsteadily to
his feet, grasping the boy&#8217;s hand in both of
his, then without a word stepped quickly out
of the launch and was lost in the night.</p>

<p>Phil was so astonished at the man&#8217;s action
that it was some moments before he realized
that a ring had been left in his hand. He
examined it eagerly in the dim light of an
oil lantern; what was his surprise to find that
it was of massive carved gold, set with a green
jade stone.</p>

<p>As the launch was secured alongside of the
&#8220;Ph&#339;nix&#8217;s&#8221; gangway, Phil stepped to the
coxswain&#8217;s side and took the sailor&#8217;s rough
hand in his own, much to the embarrassment
of the latter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Blake,&#8221; the lad said earnestly, &#8220;you saved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
my life, and you did it as coolly as if you had
been only making a landing alongside the
ship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was nothing, sir,&#8221; the coxswain answered
quickly, his face beaming; &#8220;but to
think of your jumping into this river to save
a Chink,&#8221; he added admiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;My act was upon impulse,&#8221; Phil declared
earnestly, &#8220;and took no real nerve, while you
deliberately measured your chances and saw
that the odds were dead against you; one
slip, one spoke too little helm, one revolution
too few with the engines, and you and your
crew would have been swept underneath that
mass of junks, and knowing this you took the
chance and had the nerve and grit to steer
your boat cleverly to safety and me with her.
My act is insignificant beside yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leaving the coxswain still wondering at his
words of praise, Phil reported his return and
went at once to his room for dry clothes.
Although the hour was early, and there were
many things over which he would have liked
to talk with Sydney and their new friend
Langdon, when once in dry, warm clothes he
found his exertions of the past hour had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
sapped his strength, and he was soon fast
asleep. Nor did he awake until the sun was
streaming in through his port-hole.</p>

<p>Turning out promptly, and making a hasty
toilet, he was soon in the mess-room, where
he found the full mess at breakfast, and all
discussing the seriousness of the present crisis.</p>

<p>As he put his hands on the table the
brightness of the ring the Chinaman had
given him startled him; the deep green of
the stone stood out clearly against the white
tablecloth. Langdon, sitting beside him,
espied it immediately and grasped the boy&#8217;s
hand, examining the ring closely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Royal jade!&#8221; the pilot exclaimed. &#8220;Where
did you get it? That&#8217;s one of the finest stones
I&#8217;ve seen in years.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil felt abashed, not wishing to relate his
experience before the mess.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you later,&#8221; he whispered, withdrawing
his hand before the attention of the
rest of the mess could be attracted. Then
turning to the executive officer, presiding
at the head of the mess-table, he asked anxiously:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there any news, sir, about sending the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
guard to the legation? If it is going I should
like to be allowed to go in the detail.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney hastened to add his plea to go
along also, and Mr. Webster&#8217;s face broadened
in an amused smile as he watched the eager
faces of the midshipmen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can tell you,&#8221; he replied heartily, &#8220;that
you are both in the detail, so you may rest
easy. I for one hope there will be no
necessity for the expedition. China is a
dangerous country when once aroused.&#8221;
Then, turning to Phil, whose joy showed
plainly in his face, while his pulses beat
faster, he added:</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this we hear about your rescuing
a Chinaman from drowning last night? It&#8217;s
all about the ship forward, yet aft here we&#8217;re
the last to hear of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil colored painfully while he outlined
the episode of the river; he said but little
of his part, but praised unstintingly the coolness
and courage of the coxswain of the launch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Coxswain Blake belittles his own part
as much as you praise it,&#8221; Mr. Webster remarked
kindly, as the officers rose from the
breakfast table.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>In Phil&#8217;s room after breakfast, Langdon
examined the ring closely in hopes of discovering
a clew to the identity of the
owner.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing here to tell,&#8221; the pilot
announced after careful scrutiny, handing
the ring back to the midshipman; &#8220;it&#8217;s of
great value among the Chinese; undoubtedly
the man was rich and he left with you the
only article of value he was then wearing.
The Chinese are a queer lot; their superstitions
will not allow them to save a fellow-being
from drowning, but when they themselves
are saved by a foreigner they will at
once put aside the obligation by giving their
rescuer a costly gift. Your Chinaman doubtless
considers his debt is paid.&#8221;</p>

<p>After breakfast was over the midshipmen
asked and received permission to visit the
foreign concession.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must go in uniform,&#8221; Lieutenant
Webster replied to their request, &#8220;and the
captain&#8217;s positive orders are not to enter the
Chinese city.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads quickly agreed to keep to this
rule, and a half hour later the &#8220;Ph&#339;nix&#8217;s&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
steam launch landed them on the stone jetty
abreast the ship.</p>

<p>Here they were immediately surrounded
by a score of Chinese ricksha coolies, each one
anxious to enlist their patronage in engaging
a jinricksha, which is the customary conveyance
of the far Eastern countries. The lads
were soon seated each in one of these miniature
carriages; and the coolies in the shafts darted
off at a lively pace down the smooth macadamized
roadbed of the Bund.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where shall we go first?&#8221; Sydney questioned,
raising his voice so as to be heard
above the rattle of the wheels.</p>

<p>Phil shook his head in sign of perfect indifference.
The sensation of riding in one of
these novel carriages for the first time was
distinctly pleasant. He felt half exhilarated
and half ridiculous. However, before they
had traveled a block, he lost his feeling that
every one was looking at him, a grown man
riding in a baby carriage, and began to thoroughly
enjoy the situation. The throngs on
the streets interested him, and the color
scheme pleased his eye; the gayly dressed natives
sprinkled here and there with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
more sombre garb of the Europeans or Americans.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; he answered as Sydney repeated
his question. &#8220;Let them take us
wherever they will. Later, though, I want
to go to the bank and buy a draft to send
home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here we are,&#8221; he added suddenly, making
energetic efforts to stop his own ricksha
in its mad career, as he espied the sign on a
great stone building: &#8220;Hongkong Bank.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads alighting, bidding by sign their
rickshas to wait, entered the wide doorway of
the bank.</p>

<p>Here they met scores of Chinamen pouring
continually in and out, depositing or drawing
out great sacks of Mexican dollars, the
token currency of China. Behind the counters,
although the bank was owned by an
English corporation, Phil saw only Chinese.
Millions of dollars daily passed through their
hands.</p>

<p>Leaving Sydney gazing interestedly at the
scenes of activity, Phil moved over to a desk
upon which were paper and ink laid out for
the bank customers. As he drew near, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
took casual note of a foreigner standing with
his back toward the door, engaged apparently
in writing. At the man&#8217;s feet he saw a
neatly folded paper lying. Apparently it had
just been dropped from the foreigner&#8217;s pocket.
Stooping down, Phil picked it up, hastily
glancing over it to see if it was of sufficient
consequence to ask the stranger if it were his.
He had barely time to note that the writing
was in English when it was roughly seized
from his hand, and looking up in surprise, he
found himself confronted by an angry, excited
face, whose dark, piercing eyes snapped with
uncontrolled passion. The stranger thrust
the letter into his pocket with one hand,
while the other was closely clenched as if he
were about to strike down the innocent offender.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by trying to read my
letter?&#8221; the foreigner cried in a voice full of
wrath.</p>

<p>The blood mounted to Phil&#8217;s forehead as
he returned unflinchingly the stranger&#8217;s wild
look. He was about to answer an apology
when the foreigner&#8217;s cutting voice stayed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just like you officious Americans,&#8221; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
stranger exclaimed, surveying the neat blue
uniform of the American midshipman;
&#8220;always meddling in some one else&#8217;s affairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble, Phil?&#8221; Sydney asked
in alarm, hastening to his friend&#8217;s side, upon
seeing the look on Phil&#8217;s face and the menacing
attitude of the other.</p>

<p>By an effort Phil controlled himself. His
first thought was then and there to settle accounts
with this infuriated man; but wiser
counsel prevailed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not read your letter,&#8221; he retorted in a
dignified voice. &#8220;I wished only to see if it
was of any consequence in order to restore it
to its owner.&#8221; Then realizing that his conciliating
answer had not changed the attitude
of the stranger, he added in a voice of self-contained
anger:</p>

<p>&#8220;If you got what you deserved, it would be a
sound thrashing for your slanderous tongue.&#8221;</p>

<p>The foreigner, hearing the lad&#8217;s just rebuke,
and seeing by his muscular frame that he was
capable of carrying his implied threat into
execution, shrugged his shoulders eloquently,
pocketed his papers and walked sullenly toward
the door of the bank.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>Phil stood his ground, his eyes defiantly
following the stranger until the swinging
doors closed behind him.</p>

<p>Sydney was told of the cause of the unexpected
dispute and was eager to follow the
foreigner and demand an apology, but Phil
only laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got in the last word; that&#8217;s something,&#8221;
he said, as he quietly wrote out his order for
the draft. &#8220;I wonder who he is. By his
accent I should say he was of a Latin race.
He spoke to me in good English, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you suppose he is a naval officer from
a foreign gunboat?&#8221; Sydney asked by way
of an answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; he&#8217;s probably some beach-comber,&#8221;
Phil answered testily, taking his paper to the
cashier&#8217;s desk. &#8220;And as far as I am concerned
I don&#8217;t care who he is. He&#8217;s not of
sufficient importance to give him any more
attention,&#8221; he added, shutting his firm jaws
with a snap in dismissing the unpleasant incident.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Let&#8217;s forget him.
There are lots of things here more amusing.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE PERIL AT THE MISSION GATE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Upon</span> their return on board the &#8220;Ph&#339;nix,&#8221;
the midshipmen found all was activity. A
message had been received from Emmons
which had decided Commander Hughes to
wait no longer before sending the guard to
protect the defenseless mission on the hill
some miles from the town. Persistent rumors
were current that the Chinese outlaws would
very soon make an effort to efface this
heathen blot of stone from their sacred soil.</p>

<p>In the course of a half hour all was in
readiness to embark the guard. Tents, rations,
Colt gun and rifles were carried into the waiting
boats, and in a few minutes more the
small party of officers and men found themselves
on the stone jetty, immediately in front
of the Chinese city. Under the eyes of a
quickly-gathered, curious crowd of Chinese,
the sailors formed and marched along the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
road skirting the fortified wall of the city.
After some miles had been covered, the great
buildings of the mission came in sight, and
soon after they were admitted within the
walled compound by the anxious missionaries,
whose dread of Chinese cruelty had been
acquired through long residence among these
fanatical people. Many of their number they
had seen sacrificed by the lawless element of
a superstitious and conservative race, whom
they had come thousands of miles to civilize
according to their Western standards.</p>

<p>The sailor sentinels were quickly stationed
at the four corners of the walled compound,
and the peaceful mission was soon transformed
into a warlike fortress.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think of all this?&#8221; inquired
Phil of the pilot after the lads had finished
their duties of preparing for the defense.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; answered Langdon, a grim smile
on his face, &#8220;that these missionaries are wise
to build their houses inside of a stone fort.
The only way to succeed in civilizing the
Chinese is to make sure that they don&#8217;t kill
you before you&#8217;ve had a chance to show them
the benefits of our methods.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>&#8220;But I mean,&#8221; urged Phil, &#8220;do you believe
that there&#8217;s going to be trouble?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen a great number of these
threatened uprisings,&#8221; replied Langdon
thoughtfully, &#8220;come to nothing for the want
of a leader with energy enough to keep alive
the spark of fanaticism; I hope this one will
follow in their footsteps, for if the Chinese
ever awaken to the knowledge of their power,
our small force of ships and men could never
stem the rising flood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see the forts over yonder?&#8221; he continued,
pointing to the numerous heavy gun
emplacements on the heights below the city;
&#8220;those batteries command the anchorage occupied
by the allied fleet, and their garrisons
are now wavering between their loyalty to the
government at Peking, and their families and
friends taking an active part in the intrigues
against the lives of the foreigners. If those
guns were turned against us, our position here
would indeed be a serious one.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two midshipmen, listening to the
words of one who had lived ten years among
the Chinese, felt their hearts beat faster:
secretly they were glad that their cruise in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
the Orient was likely to be fraught with grave
dangers.</p>

<p>The missionaries and their numerous
Chinese converts inside the walled mission
were once more at ease; they believed that
all danger was past: the Chinese had never
attacked a mission so strongly defended by the
rifles of the hated but much feared foreign
sailors.</p>

<p>The hot day came to an end, and the night
wind from the distant mountains brought to
the anxious ones a desire for sleep which they
had not felt for days.</p>

<p>Phil and Sydney lay awake long after the
mission was wrapt in slumber. They had
talked over the situation very thoroughly,
the views of Langdon having made a deep
impression on their minds. There certainly
was a danger! Could the Chinese troops be
depended upon to withstand the bribes of the
lawless ones?</p>

<p>Sydney&#8217;s even breathing, at last, showing
that he had fallen off to sleep, cut short
further conversation between them; while
Phil, casting an annoyed glance at the unconcerned
sleeper on the adjoining cot, arose and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
silently left the tent; he was far from asleep
and, being the officer of the guard for the
night, determined to make an inspection of the
sentries.</p>

<p>The night was dark save for the dim light
shed by the crescent moon low in the western
sky. Ascending the mission stairs, he stepped
out on the broad top of the high barrier of
brick and mortar and walked down the wall.
A sentry was posted at the near corner of the
quadrangle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is everything all right?&#8221; he asked quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, but I seen a bunch of Chinese up
there near the gate a few minutes before you
come,&#8221; the sailor made answer. &#8220;I hollered
at &#8217;em, and they ain&#8217;t stopped runnin&#8217; yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What can I do if they don&#8217;t run?&#8221; he
added, questioningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing; just call the sergeant of the
guard,&#8221; replied Phil quickly. &#8220;On your life
don&#8217;t shoot without orders.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If a Chink shoots at me, sir, can&#8217;t I fire
back?&#8221; the sailor asked, casting an apprehensive
glance into the darkness outside of
the compound.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Wilson had instructed the midshipmen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
to make certain that the sentries did
not fire first: the viceroy of the province was
believed to be striving to hold the malcontents
in check, but an untimely shot might precipitate
hostilities.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are fired upon,&#8221; Phil ordered, &#8220;fire
your piece and arouse the garrison, but don&#8217;t
shoot unnecessarily.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, aye, sir,&#8221; the sailor answered, as the
midshipman drew away up the wall to visit
the next sentry.</p>

<p>While Phil was crossing the stone archway
over the heavily-barred iron gate, the main
entrance into the mission, he was attracted by
a dark object on the ground below him, close
up to the metal doors.</p>

<p>A closer look filled the boy&#8217;s thoughts with
an unknown dread. The object appeared
harmless enough, and yet why was it there
against the gate of the mission? Phil saw
now that it was a large box, outlined dimly in
the shadow of the archway.</p>

<p>He peered about him uncertainly. He
could see the two lookouts at the wall&#8217;s corners;
they were alert and yet in ignorance of
the danger at the mission gate. The midshipman&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
thoughts dwelt on the information
given by the sentry with whom he had just
spoken: there had been some Chinamen at
the gate but a few moments ago! Was this
box harmless or did its presence there foretell
a warlike design against the hundreds of non-combatants,
women and children, now under
the protection of the American sailors?</p>

<p>His startled gaze traveled over the gloomy
expanse of surrounding country outside of the
high wall: the shadowy mounds, graves of
departed Chinese, dotting the grassy slopes
about the compound might be now concealing
an armed force of attacking fanatics; beyond
the graves it rested for a moment on the low
mud walls of abandoned houses, believed by
their owners to be forever polluted by the close
presence of the despised foreigners. Down on a
lower level the high walled city lay sleeping;
the closely packed roofs resembling a continuous
floor, upon which fell the dim light of the
waning moon; then again it descended to the
silent waters of the river, the towering pagodas
along its banks standing like guardian sentinels,
with the anchored ships a phantom fleet
upon its dark surface.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>A spark-like glint below him caught his
eye, and its ominous message sent the blood
from his heart. With every faculty alert Phil
threw himself at full length on the wall and
peered anxiously below into the deeper shadow
of the gateway: a sputtering spark but a few
feet away from the box told only too plainly
its terrible mission: there was an explosive
against the gates, and the crawling point of
fire was the live end of the slow-match, surely
and deliberately burning its way toward the
captive force that would, in a fraction of a
minute, hurl the powerful gates asunder, thus
letting in the ambushing Chinese, doubtless
watching and waiting, concealed in the misty
shadows.</p>

<p>The lad&#8217;s heart stood still as it flashed upon
him what his duty demanded of him. If he
were a second too late he would be blown to
pieces and yet the gates would be shattered
and useless to protect the mission. His mind
was made up quickly: he must first warn the
garrison and then quench the fatal spark
twenty feet below him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Turn out the guard!&#8221; he cried loudly;
then as he heard the startled sentries repeat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
his words, he dropped silently to the ground
on the outside of the compound and grasped
the lighted end of the fuse between his fingers,
but a few inches from its awful goal.</p>

<p>He heard the startled cries of his companions
awakened from their sleep by the alarming
summons; the rattle of rifles and accoutrements
as the sailors hastened to their stations
on the wall. The reaction had now set in;
the boy&#8217;s limbs seemed about to fail him.
Almost unstrung he clung to the box while
he collected his scattered thoughts. If the
box remained there the enemy might yet succeed
in exploding its contents against the gate.</p>

<p>With his body pressed close to the torpedo,
and in its deeper shadow, his ear detected a
sound near him in the grass at the edge of the
road. Suddenly a figure darted forward
across the archway and stopped on the other
side of the box, fumbling with its top, as if to
relight the fuse. Phil held his breath as he
reached forth his hand and clutched the wrist
of the intruder. Drawing the surprised man,
with all his force, across the box, he threw
him to the ground. A cry escaped the
captive as he felt the strong arms of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
midshipman enfold him, smothering him to
the earth.</p>

<p>The two bodies heaved and strained; the
efforts of the Chinaman became visibly weaker,
and finally Phil cast the insensible form from
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who goes there?&#8221; in excited tones from
above him showed him that aid was near. A
sailor peered over the wall immediately
above the lad&#8217;s head, his menacing rifle
covering the exhausted boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Midshipman Perry, the officer of the
guard,&#8221; he whispered hoarsely; &#8220;heave me a
line, quick! Keep the gate closed! The
place is full of Chinese!&#8221;</p>

<p>A rope dangled down from a corner of the
archway and Phil, grasping its end, quickly
made it fast around the box, giving the signal
to hoist.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be careful, that&#8217;s powder,&#8221; he cautioned;
&#8220;send the end back for me. Hurry,&#8221; he
added, casting a fearsome look into the
shadows behind him.</p>

<p>With the end of the rope in his hand he
stooped down to tie it about the body of his
captive; when, without a moment&#8217;s warning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
he felt a stinging blow in the face, that sent
him reeling to the wall. He clutched wildly
at the offender, now on his feet and struggling
madly to free himself from the terrifying embrace
of the midshipman. The fully recovered
celestial fought with the strength
of despair, uttering piercing shrieks which
seemed to be answered from the surrounding
darkness.</p>

<p>Suddenly Phil was wrenched nearly off his
feet, and then fell backward against the wall,
the torn coat of the man in his hands,
while the escaping prisoner melted into the
night.</p>

<p>Hand over hand, up the rope, it was but
the work of a second to the top of the wall,
and there he found an anxious group of
officers and men who had watched, with bated
breath, the struggle below them.</p>

<p>Phil explained the circumstances at once
to Lieutenant Wilson.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel sure they&#8217;re concealed all about
here,&#8221; he ended excitedly. &#8220;I heard answers
to the man&#8217;s cries.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lieutenant Wilson turned to Langdon, who
had been an eager listener.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>&#8220;Is it an attack, Langdon?&#8221; he asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>Langdon shook his head, much mystified,
then the garment in Phil&#8217;s hand caught his
eye. He took it from the lad in silence and
carried it down from the wall, entering the
small gate-house inside the compound.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep a strict watch, Mr. Monroe,&#8221; the
lieutenant ordered, motioning Phil to follow
him, and together they entered the room
where Langdon was carefully examining the
garment.</p>

<p>It was a blue tunic, plain save for a white
border and a number of Chinese written characters
on its back. It was this lettering that
Langdon was studying.</p>

<p>&#8220;Viceroy Chang-Li-Hun,&#8221; he read slowly
aloud. Then he glanced up, a worried expression
on his usually calm face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Wilson,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it&#8217;s serious; we&#8217;ve
the viceroy&#8217;s soldiers against us.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />


<small>THE EMBASSY TO THE VICEROY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> the man with whom Phil had fought
was a soldier of the viceroy, it was indeed
convincing evidence that the outlaws were
receiving aid of the official class. Lieutenant
Wilson at once saw the seriousness of the
situation for all foreigners living within the
provinces under the jurisdiction of Viceroy
Chang-Li-Hun. The American naval man
knew that his duty required him to place this
information in the hands of his commanding
officer on board the &#8220;Ph&#339;nix&#8221; immediately, in
order that all the foreign powers represented
might know that the threatened uprising was
no longer one of unorganized, misguided
coolies or working men, but was at the instigation
of the powerful mandarins, receiving
their instructions, no doubt, directly from the
viceroy himself. Did he dare take the risk
of sending messengers out of the mission at
this time when the enemy were doubtless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
gathered about the walls of the compound,
perhaps even now making up their minds to
attack the defending garrison? Yet in the
morning affairs might have grown even worse:
the morrow&#8217;s sun might see the mission besieged,
and every outlet barred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Langdon,&#8221; Lieutenant Wilson questioned,
after an impressive silence, while his companions
waited, looking to him to give the
orders which each felt the terrible development
demanded, &#8220;are you sure that you
have read these characters correctly? We
must not alarm the foreigners unnecessarily.
Might not this garment have been worn by
a discharged soldier? Are we safe in assuming
that the viceroy is back of this attempt
on the gate because one of the culprits wears
his uniform?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is possible, sir,&#8221; Langdon answered
thoughtfully, &#8220;but I believe improbable.
This plan is not one that could be conceived
by a stupidly ignorant coolie mob; you can
see for yourself it must have been devised by
those who have some knowledge of the use
of explosives; and knowing as they must
that the mission is being guarded by American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
sailors, it was intended as an affront to the
nation that they represent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe you are right, Langdon,&#8221; the
lieutenant agreed promptly. &#8220;I shall act
upon your judgment; your knowledge of the
Chinese should make your reasoning sound.&#8221;
Then he turned to the expectant midshipmen:
&#8220;Mr. Perry, this news must be taken to
Captain Hughes to-night; I offer you the
chance to go; your right to be chosen can&#8217;t
be disputed: your discovery of the viceroy&#8217;s
treachery and your heroic conduct in frustrating
his design has won you the privilege.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil flushed with pleasure at his senior&#8217;s
words of praise, while he stammered out his
readiness to undertake the hazardous enterprise.
Asking that Sydney accompany him
he received a ready assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you spare me, too, sir?&#8221; Langdon
asked earnestly. &#8220;I know every foot of the
land about here; I&#8217;ve shot pheasant all over
these hills, and understanding the language,
may be a help to Mr. Perry if he should be
stopped by the natives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, certainly,&#8221; the lieutenant replied
quickly, his face showing his appreciation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
the pilot&#8217;s offer. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t order you, but
your desire to go speaks highly of your courage.
It is our duty, as naval men, to expose
ourselves to danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s bred in me, too, sir,&#8221; Langdon
answered. &#8220;I served with the flag during my
boyhood, and am ever ready to sacrifice all I
have for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not encumber you with useless
messages,&#8221; Lieutenant Wilson said finally to
Phil as he turned to leave the gate-house and
return to the wall; &#8220;you know the situation
and can explain our fears to Captain Hughes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The midshipmen and the pilot went to prepare
themselves for their journey, while their
senior ascended the wall to dispose his small
force in order to guard all approaches and
prevent a surprise. There would be few eyes
closed in sleep that night; the gravity of the
situation was fully impressed on even the
sailors accustomed as they were to danger.</p>

<p>Hastily arming themselves with a pair of
revolvers each and with plenty of ammunition,
the three volunteers again ascended the
wall.</p>

<p>The moon had set and the land about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
mission was veiled in darkness. The men
moved slowly along the wall of the compound,
while Langdon&#8217;s keen eyes peered into the
night to discover the best location to leave
the mission. They had traversed nearly half
of the wall and were at the far end of the
compound before the pilot seemed satisfied
that the way was clear. He put out his hand
and touched Phil on the shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll leave from here,&#8221; he whispered;
&#8220;the Chinese, if they are about, are all in
the front. See; the land is clearer; there are
not so many graves as in the front to conceal
an enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Throwing themselves down on top of the
wall they grasped its edge, and lowered themselves
silently to the ground. Langdon led
the way directly from the mission, and
further into the country. The land here was
but slightly cultivated, the ground firm and
for the most part clear, so our travelers swung
along at a lively pace.</p>

<p>Having covered about a mile, Langdon
stopped to allow his companions to join
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the main road leading into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
city,&#8221; the pilot informed them as they arrived
at the narrow path in which the speaker was
standing. &#8220;We&#8217;ll follow this right into the
foreign concession; it&#8217;s late, past ten o&#8217;clock,
and there&#8217;ll be no natives on the road. It&#8217;s
our safest course.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil nodded in sign of assent, his eyes on
the Chinese road.</p>

<p>&#8220;A road, did you say, Langdon?&#8221; the boy
asked; &#8220;it&#8217;s more like a bridle-path.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the only kind of road you&#8217;ll find in
the Chinese Empire,&#8221; the pilot replied as
they moved swiftly over its uneven surface;
&#8220;the natives don&#8217;t use carriages and coaches
for passengers, nor wagons to carry their
freight, but transport their merchandise in
wheelbarrows or on the backs of the small
Tartar donkeys. In the north the Manchus
have a rickety cart drawn by man power or
by pony and there the highways are wider,
but are even less smooth, for the natives
never repair their roads.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had traveled another mile when
Langdon called a halt and cautioning silence
pointed to a grove of trees ahead of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;A village,&#8221; he answered the questioning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
looks of his companions; &#8220;we&#8217;ll leave the road
and circle it. The wind is from the river, so
I hope the dogs which inhabit these small
towns will not smell us. These Chinese curs
have a keen nose for a foreigner and if our
enemy is about they might warn him of our
presence.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they skirted the village Sydney glanced
with interest down into the mean and ill-smelling
collection of mud-walled hovels, situated
below the level of the surrounding country.
He had heard that this location was chosen to
protect its occupants from the blasts of the winter
gales, and in consequence during the wet
season the floods from the heavy and prolonged
rains swept down upon them, carrying
off bodily their insecure buildings and frequently
drowning many of the unfortunate inhabitants.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will the Chinese ever learn to build their
villages in a common-sense way?&#8221; he asked
the pilot.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve done the same thing for twenty
centuries,&#8221; Langdon answered, following Sydney&#8217;s
gaze; &#8220;what was good enough for their
ancestors is good enough for them, is their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
motto, and nothing that we can say will ever
move them. After you&#8217;ve been here for a few
years, Mr. Monroe, you&#8217;ll cease wondering at
anything you see the Chinese do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly the lads felt themselves grasped
by the strong hands of Langdon and drawn
down into the thick grass. The silence was
broken by a faint sound of voices that seemed
to come from directly below them. Langdon
motioned the boys to remain where they were,
and crawled noiselessly forward to the edge of the
embankment surrounding the village. Phil
could now hear a high-pitched nasal voice,
raised excitedly after the Chinese fashion, with
many loud and piercing notes. He could see
Langdon ahead of him partly hidden in the
grass, and his curiosity was aroused to know
what this midnight meeting might foretell.
Then the voices ceased and the noise of tramping
feet came clearly to his ears. From out
of the shadows, but a few yards from where
Langdon was lying, a squad of Chinese soldiers
moved off into the night, over the road they
were traveling, toward Ku-Ling.</p>

<p>After a few minutes had elapsed, the soldiers&#8217;
footfalls dying away in the distance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
Langdon rose to his feet and joined the impatient
midshipmen.</p>

<p>&#8220;They were soldiers!&#8221; Sydney exclaimed.
&#8220;We distinctly saw their uniforms as they entered
the road.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What were they saying? Could you
hear?&#8221; Phil questioned eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;One of them was the man you fought with
at the gate,&#8221; Langdon answered; &#8220;it&#8217;s just as
I supposed: there was a movement on foot to
attack the mission if that party was successful
in destroying the gateway. The one doing all
the loud talking was &#8216;saving his face,&#8217; as the
Chinese say; he was explaining that a monster,
half man and half bird flew down from
the wall and put out the fuse as fast as he
could light it, and that he had mortally
wounded the &#8216;devil,&#8217; but fear having entered
his heart, he had run away as fast as he could,
followed by his companions. He says that
the &#8216;foreign devils&#8217; can change into these
monsters whenever they wish, and that their
breath is like fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil gasped in astonishment at the ludicrous
account of his battle with the soldier.</p>

<p>&#8220;But his companions will not believe any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
such tale as that,&#8221; he cried; &#8220;surely they&#8217;ll
know it is made up out of whole cloth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary,&#8221; Langdon answered,
&#8220;they&#8217;ll believe it, and what&#8217;s more he believes
it himself by this time. Doubtless he was so
frightened that he remembers little that happened,
and their imagination is so vivid that
a Chinaman will generally believe his own
words as they fall from his lips.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What would have happened if they had
been successful?&#8221; Phil questioned. &#8220;That
small body of men could not have intended
attacking us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but after the gate had been blown in
it would be an easy matter for a few thousand
Chinese to gather. There are tens of thousands
of Chinamen in these small towns within
a mile of the mission. All they need is a
match to start them, and that was the intention
of these soldiers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks as if it were serious,&#8221; Sydney said
in an awed whisper as they cautiously regained
the road. The soldiers were not in sight, so
the Americans proceeded, cautiously watching
for the first signs of their enemy on the highway
ahead of them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>Finally they reached the limits of the foreign
concession, and it was after midnight before
they arrived on board the &#8220;Ph&#339;nix&#8221;;
but Commander Hughes was awake and
directed that they be shown down to his cabin
immediately.</p>

<p>The situation was quickly explained to the
naval officer by the messengers.</p>

<p>The captain sat in silence for some minutes
after they had finished, his face showing
strongly the strain he was under: all the
Americans on the river were in mortal danger,
and he and his small force were all that stood
between them and a fate far worse than death.
Phil and Langdon anxiously watched the captain&#8217;s
face as if to read the next move on the
international chess-board, which Commander
Hughes, as the senior among the foreign captains,
was called upon to make.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, the news you bring me is so
terrible in its possibilities,&#8221; the captain finally
began, &#8220;that I am quite at a loss how to act.
Our force is too small to resist an attack; we
must resort to diplomacy with this rascally
viceroy. And yet we don&#8217;t know how far-reaching
the movement may be. If we sit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
idly by the natives will gain confidence, mistaking
forbearance for cowardice, and can
readily drive all foreigners off the river.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Perry,&#8221; the captain added, rising and
ringing for his orderly, &#8220;I want you to take
the steam launch at once and go to each of
the foreign gunboats; request that their commanding
officers come on board here to a
meeting in a half-hour&#8217;s time. Explain to
them the gravity of the situation.&#8221; Then
turning to the waiting marine, &#8220;My compliments
to the officer on duty, and tell him to
have the steamer ready for Mr. Perry immediately.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil soon delivered his captain&#8217;s messages to
the officer of the deck of each of the foreign
gunboats and upon his return was detailed by
Commander Hughes for the duty of secretary
to the international council.</p>

<p>Slightly nervous in the presence of so many
seniors, the midshipman sat near his captain,
pencil in hand, ready to take notes of the proceedings
of the council.</p>

<p>&#8220;Commander Ignacio of the &#8216;Albaque&#8217; is
ill,&#8221; a young foreign lieutenant announced as
the American captain glanced at him inquiringly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
&#8220;and begs you will receive me as his
representative.&#8221;</p>

<p>Commander Hughes bowed politely in
agreement and then in a few words described
the incident at the mission.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before it is too late,&#8221; he added, &#8220;I believe
that it is our duty to lay our difficulties before
the viceroy, and demand that he take steps at
once to quell this uprising. Meanwhile we
should warn all foreigners living in the foreign
concession at Ku-Ling that if our diplomacy
fails they must be ready to take refuge
on board the gunboats. We must deal with
the situation fearlessly, for only in that way
can we expect success. Chang-Li-Hun must
be made to see the seriousness of his inactivity.&#8221;</p>

<p>To this clear proposal all agreed and Commander
Hughes was chosen by acclamation to
lead the embassy on the morrow to the viceroy&#8217;s
yamen. Two other commanders were
selected, and then with many expressions for
success the council adjourned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have my doubts of the utility of a conference
with the viceroy,&#8221; Langdon told the
lads the next morning at the breakfast table.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
&#8220;He&#8217;s a tricky Chinaman and generally has
his own way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we shall soon see,&#8221; he ended as an
orderly appeared to summon him and Phil to
be ready within fifteen minutes to accompany
their captain on the mission to the high
Chinese mandarin.</p>

<p>A half hour later a bright array of uniformed
officers landed on the jetty; there
were three of the gunboat captains and their
aides, all in full dress uniform, which is prescribed
for an official visit upon a viceroy.</p>

<p>A line of green sedan chairs, the color
portraying to the curious throngs that their
occupants were of the first rank in official
parlance, wended its way in single file through
the guarded gates into the stench of the
crowded, walled city. Each chair was carried
on the muscular shoulders of four coolies, and
at almost a dog&#8217;s trot, they bore their burdens
over the narrow, crooked streets.</p>

<p>Phil gazed excitedly upon the thousands of
inquisitive natives, crowding so near the foreigners
that the pungent odor of their bodies
came distinctly to his nostrils; their ignorant
faces at such close range appalled him. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
chair coolies cried out hoarsely, jostling the
multitude to prevent being trodden under foot
by the persistent rabble.</p>

<p>The embassy had covered but half the distance
to the yamen when it was wedged tightly
against a heaving mass of excited yellow
bodies. Phil saw the faces of the crowd
darken with a superstitious loathing; he
seemed to read in their cruel eyes an awakening
to the knowledge of their power, and the
helpless plight of the despised &#8220;foreign devils&#8221;.
The multitude pressed ever closer; reaching
out their claw-like talons to touch the gold-embroidered
uniforms of the naval officers.
The lad cast a swift glance at Langdon next
him; he felt confident he would read in his
face the extent of the danger threatening them.
The pilot was shouting unintelligible words
to his chair coolies; the while his face was
black with passion.</p>

<p>The coolies refused stolidly to budge, and
by sign threatened to put down the chairs
upon the ground; all the while jabbering and
gesticulating wildly to each other and to the
mob, which appeared on the point of engulfing
the foreigners in its noisome embrace.</p>

<small>THE VICEROY&#8217;S TREACHERY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> gaping crowd pressed ever closer. Phil
could feel the fetid breath of those nearest
him; he saw a big Chinaman emerge from
the dense throng and push his way to Langdon&#8217;s
chair; the lad would have cried out a
warning, but all happened with such lightning-like
swiftness that he had not found his voice
before the bold Chinaman had released his
hold upon the pilot&#8217;s coat, and had fallen
back into the arms of his countrymen nearest
him, a deep red stain upon his closely shaved
head, while Langdon waved menacingly his
Colt revolver, the blunt butt of which had
successfully cowed the would-be leader.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the foreigners, a troop of
mounted soldiers arrived on the scene at this
juncture and brutally cleared the way, trampling
under their horses&#8217; feet the nearest of
the mob, chained as they were by the mass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
of humanity behind them. Presently the
chairs were again in motion; the soldiers
now keeping the crowd in check, and in a
few minutes more the embassy arrived in
front of the yamen, the official residence of
the viceroy. The heavy, grotesquely painted
doors were quickly opened, and closed sharply
in the faces of the unruly crowd.</p>

<p>The naval men alighted from their chairs,
well satisfied to have escaped so easily from a
disagreeable situation; but the pilot was not
so well pleased.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in for it, I fear,&#8221; he confided to
Phil; &#8220;that was another insult. The viceroy
knew we were coming and he doubtless
planned that we should be mobbed, holding
his soldiers back to give us a few unpleasant
minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What would that Chinaman have done
to you?&#8221; Phil asked gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was an act of bravado,&#8221; Langdon answered
smilingly, the picture of the discomfited
man in his mind; &#8220;but if he had succeeded
in pulling me from the chair it would have
been serious; a leader is all these people
need.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>&#8220;Pretty tight squeak, eh, Langdon?&#8221;
Commander Hughes asked while they waited
for the summons to approach the audience-chamber.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looked bad for a time, sir,&#8221; the pilot
replied; &#8220;if some one had thrown a stone,
we&#8217;d have been mobbed then and there, and
the soldiers would have been powerless to
save us. Not in my ten years among these
people have I seen such a menacing mob.
We must deal boldly with the viceroy, sir,
or else we&#8217;ll not get out of the city alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it really as bad as that?&#8221; the captain
asked anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; Langdon answered earnestly,
lowering his voice so as not to be heard by
any save the captain; &#8220;they were in an ugly
mood, and if I am not mistaken they were
acting under orders from the yamen; otherwise
the rabble wouldn&#8217;t have dared molest
us. If we don&#8217;t keep our feet on their necks,
they&#8217;ll make short work of every foreigner in
the Yangtse Valley.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a few minutes more of waiting the
inner doors were thrown open and the naval
men were ushered into the second courtyard,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
and then through more doors to the council-chamber
of the viceroy. Here they found
Chang-Li-Hun and his advisers ready to receive
them.</p>

<p>Commander Hughes advanced toward the
viceroy and bowed ceremoniously; the
ancient Chinaman clasped his hands in front
of him and murmured a few monosyllables in
his own language, after which all were seated.
Phil found his place between Langdon and a
Chinaman, while Commander Hughes sat at
the viceroy&#8217;s left, the seat of honor in the
dragon kingdom.</p>

<p>The silence was undisturbed for several
minutes, during which time the lad gazed
covertly about him. He noticed the sphinx-like
face of the high mandarin, whose power
was as far-reaching as even the empress
dowager&#8217;s, to whom he acknowledged allegiance
but gave it grudgingly. This wizened
old man had the power of life and death over
nearly twenty million human beings. If he
so willed, he could order any of his subjects to
be brought to the execution grounds and chop
their heads off with as little feeling as one
would have in beheading a chicken. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
midshipman&#8217;s eyes traveled in turn over each
face of the viceroy&#8217;s advisers, men of great
promise in the empire; they represented the
enlightened few governing with iron rods a
people who are yet stifled in the superstitions
and customs of medieval times. Through the
open door, the lad caught a glimpse of Chinese
guards; their blue tunics similar to the one
he had stripped from the back of the Chinaman
at the mission gate.</p>

<p>Finally the silence was broken by the high-pitched
voice of the aged viceroy in his own
staccato language. Phil believed he could
read both anger and contempt in the tones of
the mandarin&#8217;s voice.</p>

<p>After he had spoken there was a moment&#8217;s
silence, then a voice was raised in perfect
English. Phil gasped in surprise as he beheld
the speaker; a Chinaman seated on the
right hand of the viceroy. There was not a
trace of the accent which he had believed was
habitual with every Chinaman who learns the
English tongue.</p>

<p>&#8220;His Excellency, Chang-Li-Hun, thanks
the high naval commanders for the honor
of this visit and desires to hear their requests,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
the interpreting Chinaman announced.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give our compliments to his Excellency,&#8221;
replied Commander Hughes without a second&#8217;s
hesitation, &#8220;and say that the time has long
passed for requests. We come now to demand
that our countrymen be protected, in accordance
with the sacred word of China given by treaty.&#8221;</p>

<p>The interpreter&#8217;s face was a study; the
American&#8217;s words were evidently unexpected;
he glanced uneasily at the viceroy as if fearing
the storm which he knew would break
forth when the sharp words were translated
into his guttural tongue. After a few
moments of thought, during which time the
old mandarin blinked his watery eyes expectantly
the interpreter spoke, hesitatingly
and as one who is not sure of his ground; but
instead of the burst of rage which Phil felt
was inevitable, the old statesman nodded his
head in assent.</p>

<p>The lad saw Langdon rise to his feet and
speak in an undertone to Commander Hughes;
then the Chinese mandarins grasped the arms
of their heavily carved chairs with indignation
and horror while the pilot&#8217;s voice in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
their own tongue rang out loudly, in direct
address to the viceroy. Then he turned to
his captain and explained his action.</p>

<p>&#8220;The interpreter did not give the viceroy
your words, sir,&#8221; he said, his voice quivering
with emotion. &#8220;I thought it best that he
should know.&#8221;</p>

<p>The parchment-like features of the aged
mandarin were stamped with hatred as he
snapped out his reply to his attentive interpreter.</p>

<p>&#8220;His Excellency is much disappointed at
the unfriendly attitude of the foreigners,&#8221; the
Chinaman announced after the viceroy had
ceased speaking, &#8220;and is grieved to hear their
harsh language.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Langdon&#8217;s voice was raised above
the silence which followed the placid words
of the interpreter: but this time in English.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those were not the viceroy&#8217;s words,&#8221;
he exclaimed turning toward Commander
Hughes but glowering at the discomfited interpreter;
&#8220;his answer was a threat against our
lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>Commander Hughes was on his feet instantly,
his face pale with anger.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>&#8220;Langdon,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;tell the viceroy
that our meeting is ended; that we came to
demand punishment for those of his countrymen
who attempted to injure our mission on
the hill back of the city, but as he refuses to
keep to his country&#8217;s treaty, we shall be
forced to resort to arms to protect our own
people.&#8221;</p>

<p>Langdon promptly translated Commander
Hughes&#8217; words to the viceroy, sitting craftily
observing the incensed foreigners.</p>

<p>Chang-Li-Hun was too clever a diplomat to
show his hand was against the foreigners; he
must appear to aid them in their endeavors to
protect their countrymen, and by the art understood
best by the Oriental he would make
these naval men &#8220;lose face&#8221; in the Chinese
eyes, and thereby show his people that the
vainglorious boasting foreigners were but
human, and could suffer and die as easily as
those of their own race.</p>

<p>A few guttural words escaped from the lips
of the aged mandarin, which Langdon translated
at once, not waiting for the unreliable
interpreter.</p>

<p>&#8220;The viceroy begs you will again be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
seated; he says he knows nothing of the acts
against the mission.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell him, then, Langdon,&#8221; the American
captain ordered, while the members of the
embassy reluctantly took their seats; &#8220;and
give it to him as strong as you can,&#8221; he continued
his wrath but slightly mollified.</p>

<p>This was all too pleasant a task for the
pilot, whose knowledge of Chinese officialdom
had not left him with much respect for their
roundabout methods. He went straight to
the point, addressing the viceroy directly,
while the latter appeared to listen eagerly.</p>

<p>After the pilot had stopped speaking and
had reseated himself at Commander Hughes&#8217;
side, the viceroy drew his interpreter aside,
and in a voice so low pitched that Langdon
could not hear a word, conversed with him
earnestly for many minutes; then the interpreter
arose and hurriedly left the council-chamber.</p>

<p>The embassy sat in silence, wondering what
would be the next move of this adroit diplomat.
Phil&#8217;s nerves were atingle with expectancy;
the dangers of their position
within a hostile city, and in the grasp of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
avowed enemy, gave his young and untamed
spirit high hopes for excitement. How he
wished for Sydney that he might share whatever
was in store for the embassy before it
again reached the safety of its steel broadsides!</p>

<p>The naval men had not long to wait before
the inner gates of the yamen were thrown
open and a battalion of soldiers filed into the
courtyard, outside the audience-chamber. Another
moment, and the light screens forming
the sides of the council-chamber were removed
and the embassy looked fairly out upon this
martial display.</p>

<p>The soldiers were quickly formed into a
hollow square between the embassy and the
outer gates, which then were likewise opened
and a seething mob of excited, riotous Chinamen
poured through, filling up the courtyard
beyond.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the meaning of this?&#8221; the American
commander exclaimed in sudden alarm;
but before Langdon could disclaim his knowledge
of what was about to happen, a part of
the square opened and a number of tightly-bound
prisoners were dragged to the middle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
of the courtyard directly in front of the viceroy.
As they approached, Phil unconsciously
turned away his head to shut out the pitiful
spectacle; the prisoners were cruelly shackled
together in a manner practiced only by the
Chinese.</p>

<p>After the lad had gained control of his feelings
and once more glanced toward the prisoners,
the viceroy was speaking, while the pilot
listened intently; the mob beyond was silent,
gazing with evident enjoyment at the terror-stricken
prisoners before the viceroy.</p>

<p>&#8220;His Excellency says that he has just discovered
that these men were arrested last
night by his guards with contraband concealed
upon their persons, and when tortured confessed
to having attempted to blow in the
gates of the American mission, and that he
will punish them in our presence as a warning
to his people,&#8221; Langdon announced loudly,
then lowering his voice, he whispered hurriedly
to Commander Hughes: &#8220;I don&#8217;t like
the looks of it, sir; a moment ago he knew
nothing of it, and now he claims to have the
culprits; it seems strange.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold!&#8221; cried Commander Hughes, starting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
to his feet; &#8220;we must have proof that
these are the right men; we want no useless
executions.&#8221; For he knew only too well that
this form of punishment was the one dear to
the Chinese heart, and he could read upon the
faces of the crowd that it was waiting joyfully
to see these human heads severed from their
bodies and doubtless had been promised this
stirring sport.</p>

<p>Langdon translated his captain&#8217;s wish hastily
to the viceroy, but the mandarin turned a deaf
ear, raising his thin, veined hand with its
claw-like nails as a sign to proceed with the
gruesome work.</p>

<p>A muscular Chinaman, naked save for a
loin cloth, stepped from the ranks of the soldiers
brandishing a sharp curved sword, and
moved quickly to the side of the kneeling
prisoners. Commander Hughes and his colleagues
started precipitately toward him as if
to prevent him from carrying out his murderous
intentions.</p>

<p>Phil saw the bright blade circle above the
head of a terrified prisoner and then descend.
He closed his eyes in horror to shut out the
appalling sight.</p>






<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>A report of a pistol shot rang out deafeningly,
and he opened his eyes to a view of
Langdon with a smoking revolver in his
hand, while the executioner lay on the sand
beside his victim.</p>

<small>DIPLOMACY FAILS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;I guessed</span> as much!&#8221; the pilot cried out,
striding forward; the guards timidly giving
way before his menacing revolver. &#8220;These
men are Christian converts; it&#8217;s but a trick to
make us lose face before this rabble.&#8221;</p>

<p>He reached the side of the prisoners and
raised one to his feet. Phil watched with
fascinated gaze as Langdon dragged forward
excitedly the chained and terrified men who
had been plucked from death by the timely
and unerring shot of the American; there
was something strangely familiar in the ashen
features of one of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;This man is a mess attendant from the
&#8216;Ph&#339;nix!&#8217;&#8221; Langdon exclaimed, pointing to
the nearer of the two prisoners; &#8220;the trick
was to execute them before our eyes before we
could interfere.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both Commander Hughes and Phil saw at
once that the pilot was right; there was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
ward-room servant who had been missing since
the day of the gunboat&#8217;s arrival; he was a
Chinaman from a distant province and unable
to speak the local dialect, and in consequence
had been singled out as a victim by the scheming
officials.</p>

<p>The midshipman feared that all was lost;
he could see no avenue of escape; the viceroy&#8217;s
attitude was certainly hostile, and how could
they, a mere handful of officers armed with
only their revolvers, hope to cope with the
soldiers of the yamen, to say nothing of the
hundreds of thousands of fanatics inside the
walled city? A single wave of that treacherous
hand would condemn them to a fate
from which his soul revolted; he had heard
of the terrible deaths meted out to foreigners
by these semi-barbarians. The lad glanced
anxiously at his companions; he saw in their
faces that they were determined to sell their
lives as dearly as possible, but the unequal
struggle could have but one ending.</p>

<p>The naval men were standing together near
the table; every eye was upon the aged
mandarin, sitting calmly, and to outward
appearances, no more concerned than if he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
were witnessing a play on the yamen stage;
Langdon remained beside the prisoners, and
not far from the soldiers stolidly waiting
orders from their high chief.</p>

<p>The situation was impressive and one to
unnerve the stoutest heart; a false move, an
ill-judged word, and those hundreds of modern
rifles might be turned against the defenseless
officers. Phil knew that nearly two thousand
sailors were under arms on board the war-ships,
ready to be landed if the embassy had
not returned to the jetty by eleven o&#8217;clock;
it was now ten-thirty by the great clock in
the council-chamber; but before the half hour
had passed all would be decided and the landing
force would not be necessary. The midshipman
knew that Commander Hughes would
not retract a single word uttered in the conference,
and that he would presently give out
his ultimatum to the viceroy, which would
either be accepted or else more foreign blood
would be laid at the door of this cruel official,
Chang-Li-Hun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be careful, Langdon,&#8221; Commander Hughes
said in a low voice, in which no emotion was
evident, although Phil could see the involuntary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
twitching of his lips; &#8220;don&#8217;t throw a
match into the magazine. Tell him quietly
that we have seen through his treachery and
wish safe conduct through his city back to
our vessels; and insist that these prisoners
accompany us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil shook with excitement as the pilot
steadied himself to give his captain&#8217;s words
to the viceroy; he understood thoroughly that
this was the only course open to the American
commander if he wished to save the hundreds
of foreigners in the province from the insults
and scorn of the Chinese expulsionists, even
though the result to him and his colleagues
was death. The lad&#8217;s mind dwelt for the
fraction of a second upon the terrible revenge
that would be visited upon those responsible
for the killing of the members of the embassy;
he thought of Canton and Peking, and how
the despised foreign soldiers had, with fire and
sword, brought home to the defilers of the
sacred rights of ambassadors the terrible consequences
of their guilt; yet there was scant
encouragement for him in such recollections.</p>

<p>Langdon had given his captain&#8217;s ultimatum
in a calm voice from which all passion had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
been expunged, and now all waited with breath
abated for the words of the wizened old man,
in whose hands the fate of so many lives
rested.</p>

<p>The viceroy at length stirred uneasily in his
chair and turning to one of his ministers
uttered a few low gutturals. The spell was
broken; a harsh command rang out, and
instantly the soldiers faced about, forcing
with set bayonets the disappointed populace
through the outer gates, which swung shut
with a loud rattle behind them. Then the
military, gathering up the two lifeless bodies,
sacrifices to the humor of a viceroy, melted
away in all directions, leaving the embassy
once more alone with the yamen officials.</p>

<p>The viceroy raised his teacup to his lips, a
signal that the visit was at an end, and then
rising slowly, he bowed coldly, and attended
by his ministers withdrew from the room. In
a few minutes the chairs were brought and
the embassy were only too glad to be gone
from this nerve-racking and fruitless council.</p>

<p>Langdon, with his usual energy, saw the
liberated prisoners seated in chairs in the
midst of those of the foreigners and near his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
own, and then stepped to the captain&#8217;s side
to report that all was ready to proceed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we shall be molested,&#8221; he
said hopefully; &#8220;it seems plain that the
viceroy will do nothing to stop the uprising,
but it appears he is afraid to openly defy
you.&#8221; Then he raised his voice admiringly:
&#8220;Do you know, captain, that you&#8217;re the very
first foreigner to make Chang-Li-Hun lose
face, and before a crowd of his own people
whom he had deliberately collected to witness
your own discomfiture. You gave us all a
close call in doing it, sir; I could hardly believe
my ears when I heard you tell me to
shoot the executioner, but there wasn&#8217;t time
to allow you to repeat it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The return to the jetty was well and safely
guarded by hundreds of well-armed soldiers
and the crowds were handled so easily that
the foreigners could readily see that the
episode of the morning was prepared for them
by the yamen officials. Commander Hughes
realized that the visit to the viceroy had
given ample proof that whatever injury was
done to foreigners by the natives of the province
could be charged to the stand taken by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
the viceroy; and with this official backing
the hostile movement would spread to insurmountable
proportions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why the viceroy permitted us to take
those Chinese prisoners I can&#8217;t understand,&#8221;
the pilot exclaimed to Phil, a half hour having
passed since the return of the embassy.</p>

<p>Phil was silent, but intensely interested.
He had just seen the foreign captains file into
the cabin, unsummoned, eager to hear the
result of the mission to the viceroy.</p>

<p>&#8220;The two prisoners came to me immediately
we got back to the ship,&#8221; Langdon continued
excitedly, &#8220;and told me of an attack
to be made to-night on the Inland Mission.
They claim to have secured this information
from the Chinaman who was beheaded before
our eyes; he was a northern Chinaman,
but could speak the local dialect. The
soldiers, knowing these men were to die, did
not take the trouble to conceal their plans.
It seems that an army of outlaws have taken
Lien-Chow for their headquarters; it is a
small town about seven miles from here on
the To-Yan Lake, and they intend to move in
a body upon the mission. These malcontents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
have been guaranteed aid from the viceroy,
and if the mission is captured, they hope to
gather enough re&euml;nforcement to allow them
to march against the forts, and the result
would be their capture, for the soldiers there
would not fire a shot against their own
countrymen. The guns of the forts will
then be turned upon us and our escape down
the river will be cut off, for these vessels
cannot face heavy ordnance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why,&#8221; exclaimed Phil, after the pilot
had finished, &#8220;should they attack a guarded
mission when there are so many others scattered
over the country undefended?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to show,&#8221; returned Langdon,
&#8220;that the viceroy is directing the movement.
To attack and massacre the inmates of an unguarded
mission could readily be attributed
to an uncontrolled mob and would be a subject
for conference and indemnity; but an
attack on a defended mission, and by soldiers
in uniform, will show the Chinese that the
war is between the representatives of the foreign
governments and their own, and being
successful will stir the whole population of
this part of China to rise and drive out all foreigners.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
I believe to-night will be one of
blood for foreigners in China, if those away
from the protection of our river gunboats
have not already paid the penalty of their
trusting natures.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must not delay an instant in taking
this information to the captain,&#8221; Phil declared
excitedly, the contemplated movement of the
expulsionists with its possible results flashing
through his mind.</p>

<p>The foreign gunboat captains were gathered
about the cabin table when Langdon and Phil
were announced by the orderly, and all listened
intently while the pilot gave hurriedly
the story brought by the two Chinese refugees.</p>

<p>A buzz of eager conversation and questions
ensued as Langdon finished. Each of the
captains had his own plans to advance, but
Commander Hughes, as the senior, was the
first to be heard. He arose, his face grave,
and at once the room was hushed; all recognized
and respected his understanding and
fertility of resource.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must acknowledge a failure in our
diplomatic mission to the viceroy,&#8221; he began,
weighing each word carefully; &#8220;the cable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
being in the hands of the Chinese officials, we
are for the present cut off from instructions
from our respective governments. We have
here every available vessel on the river, except
those necessary for the protection of the missions
farther up the country; the state of the
river at present will not admit of the battle-ships
coming to our aid, and the two monitors
of my government are by last accounts as yet
in the Philippines. We must act here and
now; there is no time for calm and deliberate
judgment; our decision must be made
quickly, and our act must be as prompt, if we
are to be in time to prevent a general massacre
of foreigners.&#8221;</p>

<p>The speaker stopped and glanced earnestly
at the faces of his colleagues; each recognized
full well the delicacy of the position.
Would their respective governments sanction
their acts, or would they find themselves disgraced
and relieved of their commands, for
not having followed a course of procedure decided
upon by their sovereigns at a great distance
from the scene of disturbance and in
the light of events which had not as yet transpired?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>&#8220;My government,&#8221; Commander Hughes
resumed, &#8220;is one of the most conservative of
those represented here; it has ever been against
striking the first blow. But there has now
come a time when humanity calls for other
and more drastic measures. You have just
heard from the lips of one who knows these
people far better than we that these fanatics
aided by the viceroy intend attacking a mission
guarded by American sailors.&#8221;</p>

<p>Commander Hughes as he spoke spread
out a chart upon the table before him,
beckoning Langdon at the same time to his
side.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we remain anchored here the guns of
the forts, if hostile, will soon drive us from
the city,&#8221; he began again, his eyes on the
chart. &#8220;Before we strike a blow we must
first embark all foreigners from the concession
and change our anchorage to one beyond the
range of the forts. With this startling news
from the Chinese prisoners, coupled with the
attempt last night to blow up the gates of the
mission, the intention of the Chinese is no
longer a matter of conjecture. We have now
to face a condition. This mission, guarded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
by sailors from my own ship, is in imminent
peril and must be relieved at once. Every
moment is precious. The means only should
now be considered by us. I have two plans
in mind: the first one is to move farther up
the river to a point abreast the mission,&#8221; placing
his finger on the chart; &#8220;from the river it
is but three miles to the mission, and we
can easily land a force after dark and march
across to its relief.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the captain finished he glanced inquiringly
at the pilot.</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be very difficult, sir,&#8221; Langdon
said quickly, reading the question in his
captain&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;True, from there the
distance is short, but we shall have to cross
a wide and deep irrigation ditch. This
canal is nearly fifty feet in depth and its sides
are perpendicular.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are there no bridges?&#8221; inquired a foreign
officer anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are several bamboo bridges,&#8221; Langdon
answered, &#8220;but they are narrow and frail.
Probably even now they have been destroyed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we must adopt my second plan,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
the American commander declared stoutly.
&#8220;We have but two thousand men available for
landing, which depletes our ships to an
alarming extent, anchored as they are under
the guns of the batteries; if we wait until the
mission is attacked and then land to the
rescue, we might find ourselves at a great disadvantage
against the many thousands of well-armed
enemies; besides, in our absence it
might prove too great a temptation for the
men of the forts to open fire on our ships,
thus cutting us off from our own vessels.
Lien-Chow, where the Chinese fanatics are
massing, is from here seven miles by land and
sixteen by water; the rebels will not leave
the cover of their city before dark.</p>

<p>&#8220;My recommendation is therefore to get
under way at once from this anchorage, taking
with us all foreigners who wish to leave the
foreign concession, and then steam by the
forts and into the To-Yan Lake. Immediately
upon our arrival off Lien-Chow I propose to
land and fearlessly attack the rebels in their
headquarters. In routing them we shall
either break the back of the uprising, or else
make it incumbent upon the mandarins, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
real offenders, to devise other plans for encouraging
this movement against the lives of
the Europeans.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you with me, gentlemen?&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />


<small>DISSENSIONS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Commander Hughes&#8217;</span> plans were agreed
upon, though not until after much opposition
by the other members of the council, and
word was at once despatched to the foreign
merchants and consuls ashore to close their
stores and houses and seek protection on board
the gunboats of their respective nationalities.</p>

<p>Inside of three hours all preparations were
completed and the international fleet weighed
anchor and, in column, the &#8220;Ph&#339;nix&#8221; leading,
steamed boldly down the river.</p>

<p>Langdon had gone to the gunboat&#8217;s bridge
to pilot the fleet through the narrow and
dangerous channel leading into the shallow
waters of the To-Yan Lake, leaving Phil and
Sydney at their guns, aft on the quarter-deck
of the vessel; for all the gunboats had cleared
for action to be prepared in case the Chinese
should precipitate hostilities. While the fleet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
was getting its anchors up from the bottom of
the muddy river, they gazed with rising pulse
at the unusual activity inside the Chinese
batteries; they could see groups of blue-clad
soldiers surrounding the big guns in their
rocky emplacements. Would the forts open
fire upon the allied fleet as it steamed past?</p>

<p>The midshipmen knew that if one shot was
fired from that impregnable fortress at the
miniature battle-ships the sound would travel
around the world. It would mean war!
The forts belonged to the Chinese government
and were manned by her soldiers; no idle
excuse would be accepted by the nations insulted.</p>

<p>&#8220;These ships wouldn&#8217;t stand a ghost of a
chance against those guns,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed
nervously as he joined Phil on his side of the
deck. The sailors stood silently at their batteries,
each gun loaded with high explosive
shell and ready to hurl its charge at the enemy
at close range if it should suddenly declare
war.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty short range,&#8221; Phil declared,
&#8220;and our gun pointers could send every shell
through those rock gun ports. A fleet of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
gunboats would drive the Chinese gunners
from their guns.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One Chinese shell, though, would sink
us,&#8221; Sydney returned, intent upon gaining his
point. &#8220;However, let them go ahead. Those
rascals will find the &#8216;Ph&#339;nix&#8217; will give them
a surprise-party.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The monitors are what we need,&#8221; Phil
exclaimed, &#8220;but they are over a thousand
miles away, broiling in the heat of Manila.
With the monitors here the forts could be
silenced and captured by the fleet.&#8221;</p>

<p>The long column of moving gunboats was
now stretched along the river from Ku-Ling
to the southward. The leader had now safely
passed the forts and its bow was directed down
the river for the entrance of the To-Yan Lake,
a good six miles distant.</p>

<p>It was with a feeling of relief that the midshipmen
saw the last gunboat in column, following
the &#8220;Ph&#339;nix&#8217;s&#8221; lead, pass out of
range of the fort&#8217;s guns. It showed that
China, as a nation, had not as yet openly
challenged the world to battle; but if those in
the forts had known of the avowed intentions of
the fleet might they not have acted differently?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>Under the skilful direction of Langdon,
the Yangtse River pilot, the allied fleet
steamed to the southward, leaving on its starboard
hand the high bluff point of land below
the city, upon which, fortunately, the Chinese
had not as yet mounted protecting batteries,
and then entered the shallow waters of the
forbidden lake. From this point the channel
led away from the course of the river and to
the westward behind the city of Ku-Ling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see Commander Hughes&#8217; plan?&#8221;
Phil exclaimed excitedly. He took a piece of
paper from his pocket, and drew a hasty map
of their surroundings. &#8220;Here&#8217;s the river,
and here,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is the lake, which we are
entering. Lien-Chow, you see, is ahead of us,&#8221;
and he pointed to a dull color of blue that
raised itself slowly from the muddy waters of
the lake. &#8220;It&#8217;s in the rear of the fort guns,
you notice, and our ships will be safely
anchored while we are relieving those in the
mission, which lies over there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Sydney; &#8220;but if we succeed
in repulsing the rebels at Lien-Chow and
rescuing the mission,&#8221; he went on doubtfully,
&#8220;what shall we do next? We shall be cut off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
from Ku-Ling. The forts will never let us
pass freely again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil put his sketch in his pocket. He
wanted to complete it later and send it home
in his next letter. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he declared, &#8220;we
can&#8217;t worry over that now. The rescue of
those in the mission, you see, is our most important
duty. The future must take care of
itself.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was shortly after two o&#8217;clock in the afternoon,
when the long line of vessels dropped
anchor off the town of Lien-Chow; and almost
immediately the gunboats had lowered their
small boats and were embarking their sailors.
Phil found himself in the steam launch with
Commander Hughes and Langdon; the former
had been chosen to command the expedition,
and the lad thanked his good fortune for his
assignment as aid.</p>

<p>The long line of boats, laden with armed
bluejackets, rowed swiftly toward the not distant
shore of the bay, while two of the gunboats,
remaining under way when the fleet
anchored, took up their stations where they
could shell the enemy if the landing was opposed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_map.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center"><i>PHIL&#8217;S COMPLETED MAP</i></p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>The midshipman stood beside Commander
Hughes, whose keen eyes were directed toward
the Chinese town, in which direction the
launch was heading. Phil could not discern
even a trace of nervousness in his captain&#8217;s
face, yet upon the success of this bold attempt
to coerce the Chinese mandarins his future
career in the navy rested. Langdon&#8217;s eyes
were searching the approaching shore-line for
signs of the enemy. He hastily took the spyglass
from Phil&#8217;s hand and leveled it in the
direction of a grove of trees to the right of the
middle of the town.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a piece of artillery,&#8221; the pilot exclaimed,
pointing with his glass toward the
grove.</p>

<p>Commander Hughes leveled his field-glass
and gazed for a few seconds in the direction
indicated.</p>

<p>He had framed an answer, but it remained
unspoken. A puff of brown smoke darted
from a bright flash amidst the trees, and the
screech of a shell came loudly to the ears of
the advancing foreigners, while a column of
water rose suddenly in the air scarce fifty
yards short of the line of boats.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>The two watchful gunboats, from the flanks,
opened fire with their broadsides, and in a
second the grove was blotted from sight by
scores of explosions.</p>

<p>&#8220;That relieves us of the stigma of firing the
first shot,&#8221; Commander Hughes exclaimed
gladly; &#8220;but I had hoped not to have to fire
at all. My prayer was that the rebels would
disperse at this show of force.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boats had not covered another hundred
yards when the town broke forth, in its entire
length, with a hail of rifle shots; the distance
was too great to see the flashes and hear distinctly
the discharges, but the water in front
and around the boats was cut to foam by the
hissing missiles. As the boats drew nearer,
the rattle of musketry came sharply to Phil&#8217;s
ears, while he heard again the wailing bullets
speeding by him. The attacking sailors were
silent, but the flank gunboats poured a storm
of shell into the town.</p>

<p>Phil glanced admiringly at his captain; the
latter was strikingly cool in face of the
stubborn resistance with which he had not
reckoned; he had believed that the rebels
were but an unorganized mob and could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
easily be intimidated by the allied forces; but
instead he now saw that the enemy was in
force and well intrenched, while the screech
of shell and explosion of shrapnel above the
sailors&#8217; heads bore witness that these Chinese
outlaws were well supplied with modern
ordnance.</p>

<p>A few boats in the long line wavered and
held back, but the majority kept steadily on,
followed in but a few seconds by those less
brave.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we ground,&#8221; Commander Hughes
commanded, &#8220;you go to the right, Perry, and
you, Langdon, to the left: tell the officers to
advance at double time straight upon the intrenchments.
We dare not stop now; given
the slightest encouragement, the Chinese
could repulse us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil felt the launch tremble, and then a
grating sound told him the boat had reached
as near the shore as its draft would allow.
Without hesitation, he jumped waist-deep
into the water and waded to the shore, a
scant hundred yards away. He saw his two
companions follow his lead, then he started
away at top speed up the beach amidst a perfect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
storm of bullets, giving to the leader of
each detachment as he passed the commands
of his captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Form a skirmish line and advance on the
double,&#8221; he shouted to boat after boat as their
keels grated on the sandy shore; then reaching
the last boat, he quickly turned and
raced back to join his captain.</p>

<p>Running to seaward of the advancing
sailors, he had covered but a short distance
when he found himself among a company of
demoralized foreigners; their swarthy faces
were ashen from terror. The midshipman at
once saw the danger in this panic; already
had it begun to spread to left and right; the
companies nearest the one in disorder had
halted and the sailors were glancing back uncertainly
and with increasing uneasiness. A
general stampede was not far distant. The
leader of this shameless company appeared to
be wild-eyed with terror. He seemed powerless
to stop the threatened rush for the boats.
The lad stood transfixed with horror. If the
infection spread a panic would be the natural
consequence, bringing certain defeat to the
allied arms and leaving the mission helpless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
to the mercy of the cruel enemy. Without a
second&#8217;s hesitation Phil raced up to the fleeing
officer. Whirling him about to face the
enemy, the lad cried out in sudden astonishment
and misgiving, as he came face to face
with the man who had so grossly insulted
him in the bank at Ku-Ling.</p>

<p>Phil was conscious of a look of bitter
hatred on the stranger&#8217;s swarthy face, but
there was no time to consider aught save the
danger of a panic and the defeat to his captain&#8217;s
plans.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you have us all massacred? Don&#8217;t
you see that these Chinese will run from you
if you will only turn and charge as you were
told?&#8221; the lad cried desperately, menacingly
emphasizing his words with his loaded
revolver. Then lowering his voice, he added
in flinty tones for only the officer&#8217;s ear:
&#8220;Now run straight as you&#8217;re heading; if you
turn back I&#8217;ll blow a hole through you!&#8221;</p>

<p>The foreign officer felt the muzzle of Phil&#8217;s
revolver prodding between his shoulder-blades,
close to his heart, and read the
determination in the American&#8217;s voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Encourage your men to follow us,&#8221; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
midshipman cried as the officer moved forward
uncertainly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forward! Charge!&#8221; the officer ordered
in a voice becoming bolder with excitement
as he saw there was nothing left him but to
obey.</p>

<p>The startled sailors recoiled in surprise, muttering
incoherently to themselves, and then
seeing their officer advance on a trot toward
the enemy&#8217;s trenches, they turned, at first
fearfully, then gaining courage, impetuously,
and charged straight toward the source of the
leaden stream.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later, Phil stood beside
Commander Hughes in the trenches of
the enemy, while the victorious sailors were
following doggedly the retreating rebels.
Langdon stood close by guarding a prisoner;
within the pilot&#8217;s huge fist was clutched the
Chinaman&#8217;s snake-like cue, while he eagerly
questioned the terrified man in Chinese. The
others waited impatiently to hear what intelligence
could be extracted from the much
frightened Oriental.</p>

<p>&#8220;I impressed upon him that if he did not
tell me the truth that I would kill him,&#8221; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
pilot exclaimed hurriedly; &#8220;he sticks to his
story that to-night they are going to attack
the big mission on the graveyard hills.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve but half succeeded,&#8221; Commander
Hughes exclaimed, the lines in his face growing
deeper from anxiety. &#8220;We&#8217;ve scattered
the outlaws here with heavy loss,&#8221; the dead
bodies almost filling the deep trenches speaking
eloquently that fact, &#8220;but we must push
forward at once to relieve our mission. I cannot
sleep another night until those innocent
non-combatants have been rescued. My men
are even secondary,&#8221; he added forcefully; &#8220;it
is their duty and privilege to die in the cause
of humanity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We cannot hope to succeed without opposition,&#8221;
Langdon said; &#8220;but before the news
of our fight here arouses the viceroy to action
against us, we should relieve the mission,
bringing everybody here where we can protect
them. It is but a two-hour march and is but
the natural sequence to the attack we have
made.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite so,&#8221; Commander Hughes agreed
hopefully. &#8220;Langdon,&#8221; he added in a sad
voice, &#8220;you don&#8217;t know what it is to rule a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
dozen different nationalities. It is a wonder
we can accomplish anything.&#8221; Then he
turned to Phil, who had listened eagerly, his
young face full of concern. &#8220;Recall the sailors,&#8221;
he ordered.</p>

<p>After the men had been ordered back from
their excited pursuit of the fleeing Chinese and
had fallen into military order in rear of the
captured trenches, the American commander
gathered the senior officers of each nationality
about him to urge upon them the necessity of
prompt action to relieve the threatened mission.</p>

<p>Phil started, the hot blood suffusing his
face, as he saw with sinking heart the rank of
the foreigner whom he had humiliated before
his own men. Three heavy gold stripes on
the officer&#8217;s sleeve told him the rank was that
of commander, equal to that of his own captain.
This cowardly officer was then in command
of one of the foreign gunboats, but why
had he not seen him before at the councils of
the allies on board the &#8220;Ph&#339;nix&#8221;? Was
this Captain Ignacio of the &#8220;Albaque,&#8221; who
had each time pleaded sickness and sent a
young officer to represent him?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>Further speculation upon this perplexing
situation was cut short by Commander
Hughes&#8217; forceful talk to the allies. All listened
intently; the well-modulated, clear voice
of the American held his listeners spellbound
with attention, but many of the foreigners
showed in their faces only too plainly that
they already feared the displeasure of their
governments for having followed the lead of
this strenuous American commander. Was it
not an American mission, guarded by American
sailors? Then why should not the
Americans rescue their own people? The
officer who had felt the cold chill of Phil&#8217;s
revolver was loudest in his condemnation of
further attacks; his arguments were so cleverly
worded that he soon won over to his side
the timid ones. The British captain alone
stood by the American in his endeavors to
persuade his brother captains that their one
chance of helping the missionaries was to vigorously
pursue the advantage already gained.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve not forgotten Tatnall&#8217;s &#8216;Blood is
thicker than water,&#8217;&#8221; the British commander
exclaimed as Commander Hughes wrung his
hand warmly, in eloquent silence.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>&#8220;We must abide by the decision of the majority,&#8221;
Commander Hughes said sorrowfully.
&#8220;I dare not think what will happen to those
within the mission if my men cannot withstand
the attack.&#8221; Then he turned flashing
eyes upon the group of hesitating foreigners.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you propose?&#8221; he questioned,
controlling the anger and humiliation in his
voice with some difficulty.</p>

<p>Phil saw the officer whom he had recently
humbled before his men cast a knowing look
at several of his co-conspirators, and then
heard him boldly voice his plan.</p>

<p>&#8220;My compatriots,&#8221; he began, &#8220;believe that
this useless killing of Chinese is harming our
country&#8217;s interests. We have decided that we
should send a flag of truce to the viceroy to request
him to use his own soldiers to fight
these Chinese rebels.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A flag of truce!&#8221; cried Commander
Hughes, in eloquent disdain. &#8220;How will the
viceroy answer us? Probably by throwing the
lifeless carcasses of our emissaries on the sand
for the dogs to feed upon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Commander Ignacio flinched before the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
menacing disgust in the American&#8217;s face, but
he held stolidly to his point, while all of the
allies, with the single exception of Commander
Buresford, echoed the foreigner&#8217;s proposal.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Inland Mission containing over a
hundred innocent men, women and children,
is still in danger from these rebels,&#8221; Commander
Hughes exclaimed anxiously, making
a last stand for what he considered was vital to
his cause. &#8220;Although we have scattered their
forces, they can, as we know, quickly regather.
By concerted action, even without danger to
ourselves and possibly without bloodshed, we
can march this force of two thousand sailors
over the seven miles of intervening country.
By daylight we can return here with these
refugees and then we shall be in a far better
position to again open negotiations with the
viceroy. If he should refuse to treat with us
now&mdash;by to-morrow these outlaws will have
recovered from their repulse. I beg that
my brother officers will agree with me on this
point,&#8221; he ended in entreaty.</p>

<p>Commander Ignacio craftily refused to
allow the point to be discussed; he feared the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
persuasive powers of the earnest and loyal
American.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have decided that question,&#8221; he replied
quickly, an ugly leer on his face. &#8220;Now
our business is to select those to go to the
viceroy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Commander Hughes was about to suggest
that this foolhardy foreigner should be
chosen, and was on the point of refusing to
risk the lives of his own officers in such a
dangerous undertaking, when to his surprise
the name of Ignacio was voiced by the combined
council.</p>

<p>Phil glanced closely at the foreigner. The
lad had heard his captain&#8217;s views of the possible
fate of the flag of truce. Would Commander
Ignacio accept the dangerous post?</p>

<p>It seemed plain from Commander Ignacio&#8217;s
face that the detail was not to his liking, but
in his successful attempts to overrule the
plans of the American, he had become the
avowed leader of those in opposition to the
Anglo-Saxon policy of quick action. Phil was
eager to accompany the flag of truce, but to
serve under Ignacio was indeed disquieting.
The midshipman could see that his captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
was taken unawares by the acceptance of
Ignacio to lead the dangerous mission.
Knowing the Chinese as he did, he honestly
believed they would go to their death.</p>

<p>The selection of the other members of the
embassy was unanimously left to the decision
of their leader, Commander Hughes.</p>

<p>&#8220;As my country is the most interested,&#8221;
the American declared, &#8220;I shall select my
own officers.&#8221; Then turning to the midshipmen
standing near, Sydney having left his
company of sailors to satisfy his eager
curiosity, &#8220;Mr. Perry,&#8221; the American commander
said in a low voice, &#8220;you have shown
yourself worthy of this trust. I shall send
you, Mr. Monroe and Langdon. I hope and
pray that no harm will come to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil could scarcely believe his ears. He,
a midshipman, selected for such an important
duty!</p>

<p>Commander Hughes then again addressed
the foreign commanders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; he said in a firm voice, &#8220;I
do not count on the success of this flag of
truce. If it fails we shall be forced to attack
the forts with our unarmored vessels. However,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
the decision is final. My orders are
that the embassy be sent without a moment&#8217;s
delay. We shall remain here until our
friends return.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, dismissing the allies, he took Langdon&#8217;s
arm and walked toward the American
sailors.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I only had five hundred American
sailors,&#8221; he declared hotly, &#8220;I would throw
over these half-hearted allies and march to
the relief of the mission. But with this mere
handful, failure would be assured.&#8221; Then he
beckoned the midshipmen to him. &#8220;Langdon,
you and these young men must uphold the
dignity of our country. You, Langdon, must
speak directly to the viceroy. Impress upon
him that I am in deadly earnest. If he
harms the American mission I shall not rest
until his city is laid in ashes. I shall destroy
his arsenals and foundries. The forts will
not be able to resist the attack of the American
monitors, which should soon arrive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The monitors!&#8221; Langdon exclaimed.
&#8220;Are they coming?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could believe it,&#8221; Commander
Hughes replied sorrowfully. &#8220;But we must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
make the viceroy believe that we are hourly
expecting them. He fears an American
monitor, and the thought that they are coming
may act in our favor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Preparations went forward rapidly, and inside
of half an hour, Commander Ignacio led
his small party out of the allied camp.</p>

<p>Carrying a large white flag conspicuously
displayed, the four emissaries, with an escort
of eight sailors, four from the &#8220;Ph&#339;nix&#8221; and
four from the foreigner&#8217;s own gunboat, gained
the road leading toward the city of Ku-Ling.
Unencumbered with all save their firearms,
which were carried for protection against the
marauding bands of outlaws, the seven miles
were quickly covered, and in less than two
hours the city gate loomed before them.</p>

<p>Approaching the city wall, Phil saw that
there was great commotion at the gate;
soldiers ran hither and thither, and before the
flag of truce had arrived near the stagnant
water of the moat, there was a noisy clanking
of rusty chain, the drawbridge was suddenly
raised, and the ponderous gates tightly shut.</p>

<p>The midshipmen, in spite of the precariousness
of their position, could scarcely suppress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
a smile of gratification: this act alone spoke
volumes; what must these Asiatics think of
the prowess of the foreigners if they feared
an attack from a dozen men?</p>

<small>IGNACIO SHOWS HIS HAND</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the drawbridge clanked upward, and
the soldiers disappeared hastily behind the
closing gates, Commander Ignacio, glancing
nervously at Langdon, brought his party to a
stop.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know the customs of these people;
what shall we do?&#8221; he exclaimed anxiously,
betraying that with all his vain boasting before
his confr&egrave;res he depended upon the
American pilot to give him courage to act.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have raised the drawbridge until
the viceroy can be notified,&#8221; Langdon
answered calmly; &#8220;I don&#8217;t consider we are
in much danger; of course the Chinese never
do what might be expected of them. If they
opened fire now we couldn&#8217;t escape,&#8221; he
added, casting a swift glance of disdain at the
nervous officer and giving the midshipmen a
covert wink; &#8220;so we might as well put on a
bold front.&#8221; Suiting his action to his words,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
he threw himself down on the ground, as if
he intended to be comfortable while the
viceroy indulged himself in his Oriental
diplomacy of wearing out the patience of those
who wished to treat with him.</p>

<p>Over an hour passed anxiously for the
foreigners; conversation was fragmentary and
pointless. Under the eyes and within close
range of a semi-civilized enemy, who might
refuse to recognize a flag of truce, their position
was not calculated to inspire confidence.
Then the drawbridge creaked slowly down,
and a gorgeously dressed official advanced
through the opened gate, preceded by a white
flag and followed by an armed guard of
soldiers.</p>

<p>Commander Ignacio and his party rose
hastily to meet them.</p>

<p>After the elaborate Chinese ceremony of
greeting had been concluded, the mandarin
turned to Commander Ignacio, and inquired
his mission.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have come to see the viceroy,&#8221; Ignacio
replied in English, for the Chinaman was no
other than the interpreter, whom Phil had
seen so discomfited the day before.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>With a nod of approval, the mandarin
beckoned that all should follow, and led the
way across the drawbridge and into the ill-smelling
city.</p>

<p>The emissaries and their guards passed at a
rapid pace through the narrow and dirty
streets; the curious inmates of the walled
city kept at a respectful distance, their faces
expressing wonder rather than hatred.</p>

<p>Phil, noticing the change in their demeanor
from the day before, called it to Langdon&#8217;s
attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the pilot assured him, &#8220;it&#8217;s a good
sign; the will of the mandarins is always reflected
in the faces of the lower classes. They
hate us just as much as ever, but the brisk
work at Lien-Chow has shown them that we
are able to carry out our threats.&#8221;</p>

<p>Upon their arrival at the yamen, the
viceroy received the foreigners at the second
door, one door nearer the entrance than
where he had received Commander Hughes.
This did not fail to impress the visitors.
After all, was Chang-Li-Hun prepared to
make terms?</p>

<p>The viceroy was accompanied by the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
mandarins whom Phil had seen the day before,
and in contrast to their master&#8217;s sphinx-like
face their features betrayed the apprehension
which they doubtless felt.</p>

<p>Chang-Li-Hun seated himself at the head
of the table, motioning Commander Ignacio
to a chair on his left.</p>

<p>After all were seated, refreshments were
brought, and silence was preserved until the
viceroy signed that the table be cleared; then
turning to Langdon he inquired courteously
in Chinese the wishes of the flag of truce.</p>

<p>The pilot, after a motion of consent had
been received from the leader, informed the
mandarin of Commander Hughes&#8217; terms.
Phil watched his friend&#8217;s face closely,
glancing occasionally at the dignified old
Chinaman, whom nothing apparently could
move.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a hostile movement against the
foreigners in your provinces,&#8221; Langdon commenced
in the mandarin&#8217;s language, using all
the flowery and diplomatic terms which these
astute diplomats clung to so closely. &#8220;This
movement can exist only through your tolerance.
We do not claim that your Excellency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
is giving it active support, but you are taking
no steps to smother it. That being the
case, the allied powers have taken the law in
their own hands. Having discovered that an
army of rebels were concentrating at Lien-Chow,
only seven miles from your Excellency&#8217;s
city, with the avowed intention of attacking
the American mission and massacring
the inmates, the allies have but a few hours
ago attacked them in their stronghold and
dispersed them with many killed, while not a
foreigner has been hurt. These rebels were
permitted to collect despite the fact that you
have seven thousand soldiers under your
orders capable of suppressing these outlaws.
Commander Hughes has directed us to say
that if your Excellency will give his honorable
word upon the spirit of his father that
no further outrages will be permitted, and
that he will protect with his soldiers the American
mission, and also cause to be issued and
posted throughout the provinces orders to desist
from attacks on Christian converts and their
teachers, then the foreign sailors will be at
once withdrawn from China&#8217;s soil.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chang-Li-Hun&#8217;s face was barren of expression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
while the pilot was delivering himself of
this long speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not the general of the soldiers,&#8221; he
craftily replied; &#8220;suppose I, a civilian, should
give the soldiers orders to protect foreigners,
how may I be assured that they will
obey?&#8221;</p>

<p>Langdon fearlessly gazed at the aged
mandarin, whom he knew was trying, as the
Chinese say, &#8220;to throw dust in his eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is not the Tartar general under the orders
of the viceroy?&#8221; he asked uncompromisingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I may give an order,&#8221; the viceroy answered
evasively, &#8220;but I am not a soldier;
then how shall I risk the displeasure of my
father&#8217;s spirit, when I would not know if it
were being enforced?&#8221;</p>

<p>By the viceroy&#8217;s words his treachery was
unmasked. Langdon had been told in the
strictest confidence by Emmons that General
Hang-Ki had embraced secretly the Christian
belief; not suspecting this, the viceroy had
put his foot into a trap by insinuating that
the general could not be depended upon to
carry out orders to protect the foreigners and
the thousands of Christian Chinese, who were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
alike called foreigners by the fanatical anti-Christians.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where can the general be found?&#8221;
Langdon inquired finally.</p>

<p>&#8220;His residence is in the forts,&#8221; the viceroy
answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then our mission is with him,&#8221; the pilot
declared, rising from his chair; &#8220;your Excellency
then will agree to give the order and I
shall endeavor to obtain his promise to conscientiously
carry it out. My captain&#8217;s one
desire is to spare the misguided people of the
city from the further vengeance of the foreign
powers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; the viceroy asked,
for a second dropping his mask and gazing at
the pilot through worried eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean,&#8221; Langdon answered, raising his
voice to be heard throughout the room, &#8220;that
if the Chinese soldiers and these outlaws, calling
themselves patriots, insist upon massacring
the inoffensive foreigners and their followers,
such a fire of shot and shell will be
thrown into this city by the allied fleet that
all property will be destroyed.&#8221;</p>

<p>The aged mandarin started perceptibly at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
hearing these menacing words; then he seemed
to arrive at some conclusion, for his parchment-like
face betrayed a faint smile as he motioned
the pilot to be again seated.</p>

<p>&#8220;How will the fleet bombard Ku-Ling?&#8221;
he inquired; &#8220;your ships cannot again pass
the forts if I order them to fire upon you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Excellency,&#8221; Langdon answered
boldly, &#8220;has forgotten that two American
monitors are now on their way to join the
allied fleet. With the addition of these vessels,
our ships do not fear the fire of your forts;
besides you will know that if the American
commander orders it our sailors can take the
forts with ease by storm. Our captain is in
earnest,&#8221; he urged, believing from the viceroy&#8217;s
attitude that he was weakening. &#8220;If the
mission on the hill which is under your protection
is harmed he will at once put into
effect his plans to reduce the forts and destroy
your city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall send for the general,&#8221; the viceroy
finally announced. &#8220;He may be some hours
in arriving, and meanwhile you may rest
after your journey.&#8221;</p>

<p>The party arose, following the interpreter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
and shortly found themselves in a plainly-furnished
room, where he left them abruptly.</p>

<p>Langdon immediately explained his conversation
with the viceroy, and expressed
himself as certain that the flag of truce would
be successful.</p>

<p>Phil had not as yet been addressed by
Commander Ignacio, and naturally felt disinclined
to join in the conversation. He had
surprised many furtive glances from the foreign
captain, and was sure they were not of
good omen; however, now he smiled pleasantly
at the two midshipmen, without a trace
of the ill nature with which Phil felt he regarded
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;This was my idea from the start,&#8221; Commander
Ignacio exclaimed boastfully; &#8220;that
fire-eating captain of yours came near getting
us in a nice muddle, but I believe I shall
straighten it all out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s anger flared into his eyes at hearing
this direct slur upon Commander Hughes&#8217;
actions, but his training had taught him subordination,
and he controlled the words of
censure that came readily to his lips.</p>

<p>Langdon however was not so diplomatic.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>&#8220;I beg to differ, Commander Ignacio,&#8221; he
exclaimed hotly; &#8220;Commander Hughes&#8217; acts
have made this truce possible. Until he
showed that he was in earnest by attacking
and capturing Lien-Chow the viceroy would
not have received us at all.&#8221; The foreigner&#8217;s
expression changed suddenly, and as he saw
the midshipmen unconsciously nod in approval
of the pilot&#8217;s words, a scowl of bitter
hatred appeared on his swarthy face.</p>

<p>&#8220;You Americans are an insolent race,&#8221; he
cried angrily. &#8220;What do you know about such
matters?&#8221; he continued violently, turning
scornfully on Langdon; &#8220;you are merely a
hired pilot.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s greatest fear seemed on the point of
being realized; this braggart might spoil all
through his self-conceit. Until now all had
gone smoothly; the viceroy had as much as
shown that he was ready and willing to make
terms, and now this incompetent coward had
shown his ugly hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t answer him, Langdon,&#8221; Phil whispered,
laying a restraining hand on the pilot&#8217;s
arm; &#8220;nothing that he can say will affect our
confidence in you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>The anger died on Langdon&#8217;s face as he realized
the logic in the lad&#8217;s words, and then
the strained situation was relieved by the
arrival of the interpreter.</p>

<p>&#8220;His Excellency, the general, was fortunately
in the city,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;and was
readily found; he now waits in the viceroy&#8217;s
audience-chamber.&#8221;</p>

<p>The foreigners were presently again before
the high mandarin.</p>

<p>Phil gazed admiringly at the stranger,
whom he knew must be the Tartar general.
The Manchu stood over six feet in height, his
skin bronzed by exposure, in striking contrast
to the almost effeminate appearance of the
Chinese mandarins about him. The fierceness
of his Tartar ancestors looked from his
dark almond-shaped eyes; he seemed to the
lad an embodiment of those of his race who
had many centuries before under the great
Ghenkis Khan overrun the whole of Asia,
carrying their victorious banners even into
Europe; here was the soldier leader whose ancestors
had followed no other calling.</p>

<p>The conference was again opened by the
viceroy&#8217;s thin voice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>&#8220;Upon investigation I find that the general
was not informed of the presence at Lien-Chow
of these outlaws. I myself knew nothing
of it. The mission was safe in my keeping,
but when your commander lands an
armed force on the soil of China, he must
take the consequences; I dare not interfere as
long as there is a single foreign sailor on our
shore. Before I can treat with you, every
armed man must be first withdrawn and the
ships again anchored in the Yangtse River;
the To-Yan Lake is by royal decree forbidden
water, and I must demand that the war-ships
leave there immediately.&#8221;</p>

<p>Langdon gazed in surprise at the old diplomat.
Could reliance be placed in his implied
willingness to make terms after the
sailors were withdrawn from China&#8217;s soil and
the ships anchored again in the river?</p>

<p>&#8220;That is quite impossible,&#8221; Langdon answered
promptly. &#8220;Commander Hughes will
not withdraw from China&#8217;s soil until he has
received your promise given on the sacred
spirit of your father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When your commander has anchored
his fleet at Ku-Ling and then comes to me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
apologizing for entering the forbidden lake,
then I will give my decision, but not until
then,&#8221; the viceroy cried angrily. &#8220;I have
washed my hands of your mission; by putting
sailors there your captain has taken it
from my protection.&#8221;</p>

<p>Langdon was so intent upon his conversation
with the viceroy that he failed to notice
that Commander Ignacio had changed his seat
to one beside the interpreter, and that in low
tones the latter had given the foreigner the
details of the conversation upon which so
much depended. The pilot now turned to
apprise this officer of the latest demand of the
arch villain, but to his consternation the
foreign commander had risen to his feet, his
black eyes snapping with importance, and
waved the American to silence, then turning
to the interpreter at his elbow exclaimed
in English:</p>

<p>&#8220;I consider that the viceroy&#8217;s demands are
just. I was from the first against this ill-judged
action. Tell his Excellency as senior
member of this flag of truce, I shall agree to
these terms, and am sure my colleagues, with the
exception of this American, will uphold me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>A smile of triumph played about the corners
of the viceroy&#8217;s cruel mouth while the interpreter
gave him the meaning of Commander
Ignacio&#8217;s rash words.</p>

<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;the foreigners are not
of one mind.&#8221; The clever diplomat believed
that he had at last found a way to pierce the
armor of the despised foreigner.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />


<small>HELD AS HOSTAGES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Americans were speechless with amazement.
Phil was confident that he read
triumph in the spiteful face of the foreign
commander. Langdon gazed with unfeigned
disgust at the officer who had brought defeat
to the allies. This wily Chinaman would
now refuse to interfere with the unlawful acts
of his subjects; trusting to the dissensions of
the allies to bring their punitive efforts to
naught. All realized that now even their
own lives were in peril, and they were powerless
to interfere. Commander Ignacio was the
appointed head of the embassy and his decision
was authoritative.</p>

<p>The Americans quickly learned the ill
effects of the traitor&#8217;s words, for the viceroy at
once disregarded the pilot&#8217;s presence and in
the most insulting tone turned to his interpreter.</p>

<p>&#8220;His Excellency,&#8221; that Chinaman said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
upon the completion of the viceroy&#8217;s ultimatum,
&#8220;sees that the ranking officer has
more intelligence than his low-caste companions,
and that as he has given his promise
that an apology will be made, his Excellency
will at once set him at liberty to return to his
people. And his Excellency further warns
his compatriots that if the sailors are not
withdrawn within twenty-four hours to their
ships, and if the fleet does not leave the To-Yan
Lake, that the lives of those held as
hostages will pay the penalty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil, throwing discretion to the winds, was
upon his feet before the interpreter had finished
his threatening sentences.</p>

<p>&#8220;Commander Ignacio,&#8221; he exclaimed, beside
himself with anger and mortification,
&#8220;can you not see what you have done?
The viceroy offers you your freedom; you
must at once insist that we are under the
sacred protection of a flag of truce and that
he has not the right to detain us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you then so anxious about your
precious skin?&#8221; the foreigner answered, an
expression of intense dislike on his swarthy
face.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>The viceroy had risen, taking the arm of
an assistant. He bowed formally, and moved
away toward his own apartments.</p>

<p>Langdon heard his parting instructions to
his interpreter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold these American dogs and send the
others back to their own people. Let their
commander tell them that when their sailors
have ceased to pollute Chinese soil then I
shall treat with them. And to show my
displeasure at the attack of the foreigners
upon our innocent people, I shall hold these
dogs as hostages.&#8221;</p>

<p>Realizing his helplessness, the pilot was
silent, and he and the midshipmen allowed
themselves to be led away by the waiting
guards.</p>

<p>Commander Ignacio gave Phil a look of
triumph as he passed him, which glance the
lad returned proudly. Doubtless this despicable
man believed he had won a signal
victory over the midshipman who had accused
him of cowardice before his own men.</p>

<p>The Americans were conducted to a room
outside of the council-chamber of the yamen.
All were too crestfallen and disappointed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
with the turn affairs had taken to care what
their fate might be. Through the windows
of the room they saw the traitor and his four
sailors pass along the courtyard on the way
back to the camp of the allies, and a few
moments afterward, their own sailors were
brought and shoved roughly into the room
where their officers were held captive.</p>

<p>&#8220;If that villain,&#8221; Langdon exclaimed
angrily, &#8220;had only kept quiet, we should all
have been returning by now. He played
right into the viceroy&#8217;s hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is all my own doing,&#8221; Phil moaned.
&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t I tell our captain the kind of
man he was?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; Sydney and
Langdon asked in a breath.</p>

<p>Phil told of the attack on Lien-Chow and
of the cowardly part Commander Ignacio
had played.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if that isn&#8217;t the queerest!&#8221; the pilot
exclaimed after the midshipman had finished;
&#8220;Commander Hughes in my hearing complimented
him upon the fearless attack of his
men; they were the first in the enemy&#8217;s
trenches after the Americans and English.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
And it was you that put wings to their leader&#8217;s
feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pilot&#8217;s laugh sounded so incongruous
that the Chinese guards glanced suspiciously
inside, fearing that the handful of foreigners
might be planning some daring escape.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel that it is my fault,&#8221; Phil repeated
penitently. &#8220;I alone am responsible for our
captivity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cheer up, lad!&#8221; Langdon exclaimed.
&#8220;It might be worse. The viceroy will soon
find that Commander Ignacio will not be
supported. He will not dare to hold us
long.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the pilot, with his wide knowledge of
the Chinese, did not know the capacity for
cruelty of this aged mandarin.</p>

<p>Even as the pilot spoke, the room filled
with soldiers, who disarmed the Americans,
binding their hands behind them and attaching
heavy chains to their ankles. Langdon
began to caution the sailors to submit without
resistance, but before he could give the advice
a stalwart sailor had picked up a heavy chair
and floored the nearest of the Chinese soldiers.</p>

<p>The sailors were quickly taken away, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
after their work was completed the guards
withdrew, leaving the midshipmen and the
pilot bound upon the hard floor. The tight
cords on their wrists cut cruelly into the flesh.</p>

<p>Phil gave himself over to despair; he could
see no way out of their terrible predicament.
Langdon, breathing heavily beside him, was
silent, while Sydney was speechless with
anger and mortification.</p>

<p>After several minutes the interpreter entered
their prison; his sallow face betrayed not a
spark of sympathy as he told Langdon to be
prepared to receive the sentence of punishment
at the hands of the viceroy.</p>

<p>The pilot growled an answer in Chinese
which caused the interpreter&#8217;s face to show a
shade of annoyance; then he answered in
English, glancing fiercely at his captives.</p>

<p>&#8220;We respect a flag of truce, but those who
land on friendly soil and attack innocent
villagers are not entitled to its protection.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil would have denied the Chinaman&#8217;s assertions,
but the next second he was roughly
dragged to his feet, and with his companions,
led into the private apartments of the viceroy.</p>

<p>There the mandarin was seated comfortably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
in his chair of state, enjoying hugely the
discomfiture of the foreigners. One by one
the Americans were forced down upon their
knees before the viceroy; the guards zealously
pulling the hair of the helpless ones as a
caution to obey quietly.</p>

<p>While Chang-Li-Hun spoke to Langdon
in a low voice, the midshipmen were held
down on their knees, their heads bent forward,
and as each moved to ease his cramped limbs,
the cruel hands of the soldiers would inflict
some new and painful torture to keep them
motionless. The strain was well-nigh unbearable;
the body bending forward brought
a heavy and increasing strain on the wrist
bindings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your two companions being officers of a
foreign navy under arms on China&#8217;s soil,
I have the right to hold them for punishment
and execution, if I so desire. You being but a
civilian, if you will apologize publicly I
will set you free at once,&#8221; the viceroy said in
a conciliatory voice.</p>

<p>The pilot stoutly refused to accept his
clemency.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would your commander really dare attempt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
to bombard my city?&#8221; the mandarin
continued curiously.</p>

<p>The severe pain at his wrists spurred
Langdon on to picture blackly the doom
awaiting the self-satisfied and treacherous
official.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you hold these officers captive, the
American commander will not rest until he
has set them at liberty. If you harm a hair
of their heads he will raze your city to the
ground and every shell will be directed at
this yamen. The inside of the wall will be
as desolate as that of your great city of
Nanking after the Taiping rebels had sacked
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The viceroy turned livid with uncontrolled
rage. He spurned the bound prisoner with
his foot, while the soldiers, seeing the anger
in their master&#8217;s face, pulled the hair and
beard of the helpless man.</p>

<p>Langdon was now beside himself. By
a mighty effort, he bore back upon the
soldiers, his great strength scattering them
with ease, and then he raised his head and
gazed full into the face of the viceroy.</p>

<p>&#8220;By holding us as hostages you are but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
signing your own death-warrant. Our mission
here was for your own good. Your people
will suffer, but the mandarins are those
whom Commander Hughes desires to punish.
You know that if your city is destroyed by
the foreign fleet you must either commit
suicide or falsify the reports to Peking which
in time will be discovered. If you liberate us
at once and give your promise that foreigners
will be protected, even now you can redeem
your action.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chang-Li-Hun could hardly believe his
ears. He had never been talked to so plainly
in all his life. His mandarins stood near him,
the scowls on their outraged faces betokening
evil for the helpless Americans.</p>

<p>Langdon was, at a motion from the viceroy,
quickly restrained, and struggling violently
in the hands of numerous soldiers was borne
out of the council-chamber. The midshipmen&#8217;s
guards were severe as they dragged the
unresisting lads from the presence of the
viceroy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear I&#8217;ve made a worse muddle of it,&#8221;
the pilot exclaimed dolefully, after they were
again alone in the room which for the present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
served as their prison. Then he recounted to
his companions what had passed between him
and the powerful mandarin.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can hope for no immediate relief from
our people,&#8221; Phil declared dejectedly. &#8220;Even
though the allies condemn Ignacio&#8217;s actions
and are willing to aid in our release, they cannot
storm the city by land from Lien-Chow.
First the fleet must pass through the fire of
the forts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is one other chance,&#8221; Langdon replied
hopefully. &#8220;The viceroy is certainly
acting without or perhaps even contrary to
orders from Peking. I could tell that by the
anger in his face when I accused him of it.
His government is being kept in the dark.
It knows nothing of the conditions within his
provinces. If the foreign ambassadors in
Peking have back-bone enough to insist upon
knowing the state of affairs, the throne will
ask for reports, and Chang-Li-Hun, as powerful
as he is, must disclose his treachery. If
these reports are not satisfactory to the ambassadors
and at the same time if sufficient
fear can be put into the emperor&#8217;s heart by
intimidating him with the threat of another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
sack of the capital by the foreign soldiers,
then he will send one of his trusted Manchu
generals with an army at his back, from a
neighboring province. When once these soldiers
have arrived in front of the viceroy&#8217;s
yamen then Chang-Li-Hun must acknowledge
himself beaten.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Meanwhile what is going to happen to
us?&#8221; Sydney asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, brace up, Syd,&#8221; cried Phil, trying
hard to appear cheerful. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been in as
bad a place before. If our time has come,
nothing that we can say or do will stop it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t that I am afraid of what&#8217;s going
to happen,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed in a hurt voice.
&#8220;If they&#8217;d given us a show it wouldn&#8217;t have
mattered; but to violate a truce! That&#8217;s what
makes me feel like tearing these shackles off
and throttling every Chinaman in sight, and
to feel I can&#8217;t makes me wish to use all the
bad words that I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil could barely suppress a laugh;
Sydney had described his own feeling more
accurately than he could himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;We may just as well keep our tempers,&#8221;
Phil replied philosophically. &#8220;It only wastes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
one&#8217;s strength to get angry, and we&#8217;ll probably
need all the endurance we have before we are
again with our own people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did the captain send any telegrams to the
admiral or Washington about the state of
affairs?&#8221; Langdon asked suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he sent one yesterday and one was
given to the Chinese operator in the concession
this morning,&#8221; Phil replied. &#8220;The last
one was a long one and outlined what he intended
doing, with his reasons. They were
all in cipher. I helped him prepare them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They haven&#8217;t gone further than the viceroy&#8217;s
waste paper basket,&#8221; Langdon returned.
&#8220;He will guard every outlet for news. Doubtless
his version of the actions of the foreigners
will be wired, unless he sees fit to remain
silent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can he remain silent?&#8221; Sydney inquired.
&#8220;The gunboats came here believing
that there was going to be trouble. Surely if
the foreign governments do not hear from
their representatives they will be suspicious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too deep for me this time,&#8221; Langdon
declared. &#8220;The viceroy knows what he&#8217;s doing;
that I can assure you. History usually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
repeats itself in these Chinese troubles, and he
is probably banking on the timidity of the
foreign governments. If the plain unvarnished
facts of the attack on Lien-Chow got to Washington
with no word from Commander
Hughes, what would happen? That is what
Chang-Li-Hun is counting on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The president would wire for particulars,&#8221;
Phil answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and he wouldn&#8217;t get them,&#8221; Langdon
returned; &#8220;and then what would happen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, but the viceroy believes he
does and he hopes that Washington will act
in such a way as to give the victory to Chang-Li-Hun.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the pilot&#8217;s voice died away, the predicament
of himself and companions came home
forcibly to Phil. His arms and legs were
swollen, causing him great pain, and the
thought of the further cruelty of those who
held them captives was not pleasant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there no way to escape?&#8221; the lad
asked, glancing about the insecure looking
prison.</p>

<p>&#8220;We might succeed in getting out of the
yamen,&#8221; Langdon answered discouragingly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
&#8220;but we could never expect to get out of the
city. There are but two gates, and both are
heavily guarded at all times. Once we are
missed from here the news would travel with
the speed of wireless telegraphy throughout
the city. No, we are as secure as if we were
on a desert island.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we bribe the guards?&#8221; Sydney
asked, casting a contemptuous glance at the
ragged soldier at the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have we to bribe with?&#8221; Langdon
asked mournfully. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t a cent about
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The green jade ring my grateful Chinaman
gave me!&#8221; Phil exclaimed.</p>

<p>The Americans took heart at the thought
of this priceless possession.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guard it carefully,&#8221; Langdon cautioned;
&#8220;it may save us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does Commander Ignacio really believe,&#8221;
Sydney asked suddenly, &#8220;that Commander
Hughes will apologize to the viceroy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That traitor Ignacio knows that he will
not!&#8221; Phil exclaimed angrily at the thought
of his treachery. &#8220;There&#8217;s more in this than
we understand. It&#8217;s a plot to defeat our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
captain, and he with only his small force is
powerless if the other nations side with this
villain. Our only hope is that the other
foreigners will not stand for Ignacio&#8217;s cowardly
agreement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those in the mission,&#8221; Langdon said with
alarm in his voice, &#8220;are in a worse plight
than ever. Unless Commander Hughes finds
himself strong enough to relieve the mission
it will sooner or later be attacked; our fifty
sailors cannot withstand a long siege against
the Chinese regular troops.&#8221;</p>

<p>The more Phil speculated upon the situation
the more perplexing it seemed. Numbers
of helpless foreign missionaries were scattered
among the cities of the provinces. Even now
many might have been killed by the lawless
element. In the past many missionaries had
been killed by mobs stirred to violence by
printed circulars sent out openly by the
mandarins. Would the firm stand of the
foreigners deter the mandarins from giving
license to their people to destroy? Phil knew
that this was his captain&#8217;s hope.</p>

<p>Langdon&#8217;s voice interrupted the lad&#8217;s musings.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>&#8220;We shall be separated,&#8221; he said dejectedly.
&#8220;Please don&#8217;t be rash. Remember the cruelty
of these people. They might kill in a fit of
anger, even though your death was against
their interests. Don&#8217;t expect kind treatment.
You will probably be liberated when our
captain has shown the viceroy that he is equal
to his threats, but I am not an officer and I
know too much to suit that scheming interpreter.&#8221;</p>

<p>That the pilot despaired of his life was
indeed disquieting news to the midshipmen,
but their solicitations were quickly cut short
by the sound of tramping feet in the hallway
outside their prison door.</p>

<p>A number of armed soldiers entered the
room and dragged the captives roughly to
their aching feet, hurrying them along the
stone pavement up the courtyard.</p>

<p>Phil saw ahead of him the unresisting
Langdon, brutally kicked and struck by his
captors as he shuffled painfully along, then
his own guards turned down a corridor, dragging
him after them.</p>

<p>Wondering what was about to happen Phil
saw a soldier knock loudly upon a door; a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
most unearthly yell from within was the only
answer, then the door opened inwards and he
found himself shoved into the midst of a
crowd of half-naked Chinamen. His heart
sank within him as he realized that he was
to be imprisoned along with the lowest of
the criminals of the viceroy&#8217;s provinces. But
a moment later he could have cried out for
joy at the sight of Sydney thrown roughly
almost into his arms. At least he would have
his friend to share his tortures; that was something
for which to be thankful.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />


<small>A CHINESE PRISON</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> arrival of the Americans in the jail
was heralded with delight by their scantily-clad
fellows; they one and all crowded about
the lads examining their uniforms and putting
very dirty hands on their white skins.
Many had never seen a foreigner at such close
range. The midshipmen were so tightly
bound that they could not escape this unpleasant,
although apparently friendly, treatment.</p>

<p>Finally Phil could bear it no longer; the
sickening odor from their unwashed bodies
became more than his endurance could stand.
Managing to rise to his feet, he painfully
crossed the damp floor to a wooden bench,
the only article of furniture in the cell;
reaching this he sat down upon it, gently
but forcefully pushing the prisoners seated
beside him until he had the bench entirely
to himself. The Chinese stood close by in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
silent surprise, showing no anger at this
treatment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come here, Sydney,&#8221; he called. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
take the bench and keep these ruffians away.
They&#8217;ll smother us with their heathen curiosity.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney crawled through the delighted
crowd, the prisoners moving aside readily for
him, and as he reached the bench and raised
himself off the reeking floor to a seat beside
Phil, the gaping Chinamen chattered like
children, quite absorbed in the infrequent
spectacle of foreign devils in their jail.</p>

<p>A number of the more bold among the
prisoners squatted on the floor close to the
bench, examining the stout boots and leggins
of the midshipmen, but these Phil motioned
away, emphasizing his meaning by a shove
from his manacled feet. The Chinamen arose
at once, their faces expressing only astonishment.</p>

<p>The lads were soon left alone; their fellow
prisoners had formed a circle around them
with an intervening space of over a yard,
while one or two of their number assumed
the r&ocirc;le of protectors and faithfully kept their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
comrades from infringing upon this forbidden
ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are more kind than their masters,&#8221;
Sydney said, after the midshipmen had
gathered their scattered wits.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor fellows, they seem as happy as if
they were only doing penance for small
sins,&#8221; Phil replied, gazing compassionately
at his motley companions. &#8220;Yet they are all
condemned to be executed. Do you see the
large ring each wears about his neck, with
a brass tag attached? That&#8217;s the mark of a
felon to be beheaded, or worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do you suppose they&#8217;ve taken
Langdon?&#8221; Sydney asked anxiously. &#8220;It&#8217;s
certainly terrible to be helpless in the power
of these cruel Chinese. They may even now
have beheaded him. The viceroy was angry
enough to revenge himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope it&#8217;s not so bad as that,&#8221; Phil
answered, trying hard to be reassuring, not
feeling, however, a particle more secure than
the condemned men about him. &#8220;Langdon
said,&#8221; he added grimly, &#8220;if our hands were
lifted up high behind our backs and they
hurried us out of the cell, our heads would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
probably be cut off in the large outer court.
Until they do that, I suppose we may be sure
that we are not in any immediate danger of
death.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney shuddered at the unpleasant
thought. And this was the China that they
had been so eager to visit.</p>

<p>Toward evening a great tub filled with
millet was brought in by the keepers and
this the prisoners devoured ravenously.
Luckily for the lads, they had satisfied their
appetite from the viceroy&#8217;s table, for they
would have stood but scant chance among
that hungry rabble.</p>

<p>The cell was now entirely dark, save for a
swinging light which streamed through the
barred doors. The midshipmen scarcely closed
their eyes during the long hours of the night,
and when the first streaks of day shone into
their foul cell, they were sitting open-eyed on
their bench.</p>

<p>A jailer brought a basin of water to the
door of the cell and then entering, took off
their irons and led them out into the courtyard.
The lads&#8217; hopes rose, but they soon saw
that it was to be only a preparation for more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
imprisonment. A bowl of rice apiece was
given them, which was quickly eaten, and
then each received a steaming cup of tea.
This reassuring meal put new life into the
lads and they felt more cheerful than at any
time since their imprisonment.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s he doing?&#8221; Sydney cried out in
alarm, as the jailer began to rub his neck
with a damp rag, while another rubbed his
wrists and ankles. Phil was afterward given
the same treatment, and then the hateful irons
were again put on, but in addition there were
put about their necks the dreaded rings,
with the dangling brass tags that jingled ominously.</p>

<p>The midshipmen were stunned. Like the
others of their cell-mates they were now wearing
the badge of death. They also had been
condemned by the viceroy and would be held
in this loathsome prison until their numbers
were called by the &#8220;Board of Punishments,&#8221;
the Chinese high court of justice.</p>

<p>Once more in their cell the lads sat
dejectedly on their bench. They had small
desire for conversation; each felt his doom
pressing upon him, and strange to say with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
this weight of trouble their thoughts turned
to Langdon.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we are to be executed,&#8221; Phil said sorrowfully,
&#8220;poor Langdon must have already
met his death.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney had not the heart to reply. He
nodded his head sorrowfully. Then a thought
struck him, and he raised hopeful eyes to his
companion&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;He must be near us, Phil,&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;Can&#8217;t we find some means of communicating?
If we could only talk their language we
might ask our jailer; he appears friendly and
probably knows.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil was silent for a few moments, then he
suddenly began to whistle loudly the stirring
music of their class song. The tune brought
tears to Sydney&#8217;s eyes. It took him back to
the day the brigade of midshipmen marched
by the reviewing stand for the last time with
his class as seniors. Two hours afterward,
with his diploma in his hand, he had shaken
hands as a graduate with the secretary of the
navy. What a terrible contrast! Then a sudden
fear took possession of him. Had Phil
lost his mind? Was the knowledge of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
terrible end too much for his nerves and had
his strong mind succumbed? While these
disquieting thoughts were coursing through
his brain, Phil ceased whistling and listened
eagerly. From a distance a high-pitched
treble of a whistle came indistinctly to their
ears amid the noises of their cell.</p>

<p>The Chinese crowded about Phil in evident
delight, while a number of jailers stood
outside the half-closed door peering inside,
smiles on their ignorant faces.</p>

<p>&#8220;They seem to enjoy my music,&#8221; Phil
said in a perfectly rational voice; &#8220;but
thank goodness, Langdon is still alive!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe it was from one of the sailors,&#8221;
Sydney suggested.</p>

<p>Phil continued his whistling for many
minutes until his listeners had become
thoroughly accustomed, then he put forth his
strategy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Langdon knows our signal code,&#8221; he said
quietly, &#8220;and I&#8217;m going to try to whistle
him a message, if we can only get these fellows
quiet. At least we&#8217;ll find out who it is
that is confined near us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then by single and double whistles, covered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
up ingeniously with snatches of tunes, he
spelled out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads waited breathlessly for several
minutes, which seemed to them as many
hours. Then the answer came distinctly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Langdon. If the interpreter comes to you
show him the ring. It may be your last
chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil acknowledged this, and then to allay
the suspicions of the jailers, he whistled several
lively tunes.</p>

<p>The long day dragged slowly by. In their
cramped surroundings they leaned back
against the wall and dozed off, only to be
awakened by the pains in their tightly-bound
limbs. The irons galled terribly.</p>

<p>At last the jailer brought them their evening
meal, a bowl of rice apiece, and before
leaving them for the night, examined their
shackles. While examining Sydney&#8217;s swollen
wrists he &#8220;hi-yaw&#8217;d&#8221; loudly, calling the midshipmen&#8217;s
attention to where the tender skin
had been chafed through, the red flesh showing
clearly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course; what does he expect?&#8221; Sydney<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
exclaimed angrily. &#8220;These irons are not
lined with velvet!&#8221;</p>

<p>The jailer took Phil by the shoulder and
led him to a corner of the cell, where a Chinaman
was lying, his pale face showing that the
poor fellow&#8217;s death was but a matter of hours.</p>

<p>Stooping down, the jailer lifted one of the
sick man&#8217;s arms. The sight that met the lad&#8217;s
gaze was heartrending. The wrist where his
iron had been was a festering sore. The
diseased flesh had slowly spread until his
forearm to the elbow was infected and the
man was dying of blood poison. Phil at once
understood the terrible danger to his friend.
He had heard of the maggot which is said to
infest all Chinese prisons. The earth beneath
his feet at a depth of a few inches was
swarming with these deadly parasites, and
their instinct leads them directly to a fresh
wound. Once this insect enters the flesh of a
victim, his death by a fearful, agonizing and
lingering illness is assured.</p>

<p>Pointing to Sydney&#8217;s irons Phil demanded
by signs that they be immediately removed,
but the jailer shook his head in dissent, his
expressive face portraying a fear for himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
if he did, while he struck his own neck with
his hand as if to say, &#8220;That&#8217;s what would
happen to me if I took his irons off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s solicitude for his friend was great.
How could he hide this wound from the
searching little worm? He thought of his
pocket handkerchief in his blouse pocket;
reaching inside his coat with his manacled
hands, he dragged it slowly out, with the
intention of using it as a bandage about
Sydney&#8217;s wrist, but to his consternation as he
pulled a bright spark of metal flashed before
his eyes and the precious jade ring fell loudly
to the floor at the jailer&#8217;s feet.</p>

<p>The Chinaman pounced upon it with
avidity, hastily concealing it in his loose
clothes. Phil attempted to hold him, but he
roughly pushed him aside, shutting the barred
door in his face with a loud slam.</p>

<p>Their last hope had flown. The Chinaman
would doubtless conceal the ring and say
he knew nothing in case he was questioned.</p>

<p>The keen disappointment at the loss of the
talisman made Phil fear even more for the
terrible predicament of his companion. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
few more days in this noisome hole might
mean his death. Ill fed, with no opportunity
to wash away the accumulated dirt from their
unclean surroundings, he must surely fall a
victim of the insidious insect.</p>

<p>Another night passed in torture, relieved
only by an occasional exchange of signals
between Phil and Langdon. He had fared
no worse than the midshipmen. Phil told
him of the loss of the ring and afterward
there was a long silence, as if the news were
too disappointing to find an answer.</p>

<p>Finally after several hours, the midshipmen
were awakened from their painful slumber to
hear the signal from the pilot.</p>

<p>&#8220;The viceroy has received some word from
the allies. He asked me many questions to-day,&#8221;
and then abruptly the whistle ceased.</p>

<p>The lads were eager to hear more, but
Langdon was silent, and soon a jailer
entered and threatened by signs to gag the
midshipmen if they continued; so, much
against their inclinations, they stopped signaling.</p>

<p>Early the next morning the lads were
awakened from an uneasy sleep by loud cries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
in the courtyard outside of their cell door.
The jailer hurried in, unlocking their chains
and signed them to follow him. The midshipmen
upon staggering to their feet would have
fallen, if it had not been for the prompt support
of their fellow prisoners, who having
risen from their earth beds were gazing
curiously through the open door.</p>

<p>Emerging into the sunlight Phil at first
could see nothing, but the jailer, taking each
by a hand, led them staggeringly across the
sandy courtyard. Then suddenly, pushing
on their shoulders, the jailer forced the midshipmen
on their knees before two mandarins.</p>

<p>Phil raised his eyes and saw the kindly
face of the Tartar general, while from the lips
of the other, a stranger, came in perfect
English as he raised the almost fainting lads
to their feet:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come with us; we are your friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jubilantly they followed the Tartar general&#8217;s
military figure, and soon found themselves
within a large room where a small table was
set, and the tempting odor of food struck
pleasantly upon their hungry senses.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_150.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><i>&#8220;WE ARE YOUR FRIENDS&#8221;</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>The lads were told to be seated, the mandarins
taking chairs opposite each.</p>

<p>Phil was fairly bursting with suppressed
excitement. Were they to be liberated?</p>

<small>FRIENDS IN NEED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> midshipmen saw that something had
occurred to bring about this change in the
behavior of the mandarins, but for their lives
they could not guess its import or the effect it
would have upon their condition. Both lads
had come to understand something of Chinese
perfidy, and determined to school themselves
to bear any disappointment.</p>

<p>Very deliberately the two mandarins finished
their meal, the midshipmen, even under
their tension of impatience, doing full justice
themselves to the savory dishes, and then the
servants removed the remnants of the repast.
Meanwhile all four men sat in silence, the
mandarins in their silken robes in great contrast
to the forlorn appearance of the Americans
in their dirt-covered uniforms.</p>

<p>At length the silence was broken by the
unmusical voice of Hang-Ki, the Tartar general.
While he talked, making many gestures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
with his hands to illustrate his meaning,
the lads racked their brains for a solution to
this unexpected treatment. Finally the general
finished, glancing interestedly at the
midshipmen, anticipating no doubt the effect
his words would have on the faces of the
youths.</p>

<p>Phil drummed calmly with his finger nail
a signal to Sydney.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show no feeling,&#8221; the latter read from
the clear clicks upon the hardwood table,
and he nodded guardedly in assent.</p>

<p>The second Chinaman was now interpreting
the general&#8217;s words, and the midshipmen
listened eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;His Excellency, General Hang-Ki, was
given this ring by a soldier who said it was
found by one of the jailers on the person of
one of the American officers. He wishes to
know from where it came.&#8221;</p>

<p>To Phil&#8217;s delight the Chinaman held up
the jade ring, which he had believed was irrecoverably
lost.</p>

<p>Phil saw no reason for concealment, so he
at once told the story of his rescue of the
Chinaman from the river.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>Then it was the midshipmen&#8217;s turn to
watch the general&#8217;s face as Phil&#8217;s words were
given him in his own language, but to their
disappointment, his features did not betray
the slightest signs of aught save interest.</p>

<p>Finally the interpreting mandarin turned
to the expectant lads, a smile on his intelligent
face. They had been wondering unsuccessfully
who this Chinaman might be, using
the English language as readily as his own.
He spoke a few words to the general, and receiving
an affirmative nod, he again addressed
the Americans.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see you do not know me. My name is
Emmons. So far I have been powerless to
aid you. The viceroy is not my friend, and
if it were not for the confidence shown me by
the general, I should before now have shared
the fate which you have so narrowly escaped.
Even now all danger is not over. This ring,
you say,&#8221; addressing Phil, &#8220;was given you by
the man you saved from the river?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil nodded silently.</p>

<p>&#8220;That part we cannot explain. The ring
is a gift from the emperor to Ta-Ling, the
viceroy&#8217;s official secretary and interpreter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
The stone is the most priceless jade. Fortunately
for you the jailer, fearing to keep it in
his possession during the night, gave it to the
captain of the yamen guard, who brought it
at once to the general. If it had gone to the
viceroy, before now you both would have
been executed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; Phil exclaimed.
&#8220;Did I commit such a serious offense by saving
this man from drowning?&#8221;</p>

<p>Emmons smiled grimly as he answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;By saving Ta-Ling&#8217;s life you committed a
serious offense against the foreigners in China.
That it was he you saved there can be but
little doubt, and he is the bitterest enemy the
foreigners have among the viceroy&#8217;s advisers.
He is a graduate of an American college, and
because of his harsh treatment at San Francisco
each time he returned to college from
his yearly visits to China, he has sworn to
avenge himself upon all Americans, and of
course all foreigners will suffer, because the
Chinese people cannot discriminate between
an American and one of another nationality.
Because of my American blood I have gained
his enmity, and while once I enjoyed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
viceroy&#8217;s confidence, now he has openly shown
me his displeasure. This uprising was started
by the wide circulation of handbills, printed
in the yamen and distributed at Ta-Ling&#8217;s
direction throughout the provinces, calling
upon all patriotic Chinamen to exterminate
the foreigners. General Hang-Ki is the only
friend that the foreigners have; he commanded
an army corps against the allies at Peking
in 1900, and knows the terrible consequences
awaiting those who dare resort to such
barbarous and uncivilized methods. Unfortunately
Ta-Ling has the entire confidence of
the viceroy, and has poisoned his ear against
the wiser counsel of the general.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is the mission still unharmed?&#8221; Phil
interrupted anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Emmons answered promptly, &#8220;the
viceroy has given the general orders that it
be guarded from attack, although Ta-Ling has
been making desperate efforts to gather together
the rebels, who were dispersed by the
foreign sailors at Lien-Chow. If he should
succeed in having the general&#8217;s soldiers withdrawn
from their camp near the mission, he
may yet succeed in his cherished wish.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>&#8220;But Ta-Ling himself has enemies,&#8221; Phil
exclaimed. &#8220;It must have been these who
attempted to drown him in the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The one who attempted to drown him in
the river is sitting opposite you in the person
of General Hang-Ki,&#8221; Emmons answered,
smiling at the lads&#8217; astonished faces. &#8220;Knowing
that the general would not lend himself
to the intrigues against the lives of foreigners,
Ta-Ling decided to put the general out of the
way. The night you saved the secretary from
the river and, as you supposed, received this
priceless royal jade ring as a reward, his
Excellency was spending the night with me on
my house-boat. The general, if possible, always
sleeps in the open air, and this aided the
would-be murderer in his design. I had been
asleep for some hours when I was aroused by
cries, and hurrying to where I had left the
general sleeping, I saw him hurl the body
of a man overboard; but the assassin had nearly
accomplished his purpose as the knife thrust
over the general&#8217;s heart will show.&#8221; Emmons
turned his tongue to the Chinese language, and
the general baring his chest, the lads gazed in
horror at the terrible wound.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>&#8220;We believed,&#8221; continued Emmons, &#8220;that
the man was only a robber, until we saw this
ring and heard your story, but now there can
be no doubt that the would-be assassin was
the viceroy&#8217;s interpreter, Ta-Ling himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it likely,&#8221; Phil asked incredulously,
&#8220;that if the man was Ta-Ling, he would give
me this ring?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t give you the ring, you can be
sure of that,&#8221; Emmons replied decidedly; &#8220;it
slipped off his finger when he thanked you.
Afterward when he missed it, he doubtless
thought he had lost it in the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you suppose he has recognized me as
the one who pulled him out of the river?&#8221;
Phil asked suddenly, grasping at the hope
that the Chinaman might befriend him; but
Emmons quickly dashed this hope to the
ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;The night was dark, and besides, after his
experience in the river, for he cannot swim, I
doubt if he remembers much of what happened.
According to the old law of China he
would not dare for his soul&#8217;s peace to take
your life if he knew you had saved him, but
Ta-Ling is a progressive Chinaman, and considers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
his self-preservation in this world of
more importance than the peace of his spirit
hereafter. If this attempt on the life of a
trusted general of the emperor were known,
Ta-Ling could not be saved by even the
viceroy. The penalty is death by a terrible
torture.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will the general report this occurrence to
the viceroy?&#8221; Phil asked excitedly, his
hopes again rising that the interpreter might
be disposed of and Langdon and the rest of
the hostages liberated to return to the safety
of their ships.</p>

<p>&#8220;The general believes that the time has not
come to expose him,&#8221; Emmons answered,
lowering his voice to almost a whisper. &#8220;Ta-Ling
is now the master of the viceroy&#8217;s yamen
and if we failed to break his authority he
would make certain of your destruction,
reporting to the viceroy that you all had committed
suicide for shame at your misdeeds.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both midshipmen&#8217;s faces broke into smiles
in spite of the serious situation. Emmons,
seeing the merriment caused by his words,
hastened to explain.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that such an idea is entirely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
foreign to the American mind, but not so
with the Chinese. If a man knows he has
committed some deed which his fellows condemn,
he is ashamed, or as we say in China,
&#8216;loses face,&#8217; and he is very likely to commit
suicide to regain his good name. And again,
a Chinaman held prisoner may take his own
life for revenge against his captors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They needn&#8217;t fear that from us,&#8221; Phil
replied. &#8220;We&#8217;ll cling to life as long as we are
able.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what the general and I have come
to help you in,&#8221; Emmons said in sympathy;
&#8220;the jailer has already been cautioned to say
nothing of the ring, and the soldier who
brought it to the general is no friend of Ta-Ling;
but even with this doubt removed your
lives are in danger so long as you are held by
the viceroy. An ultimatum was received
from the American commander last night
that the allies have refused to approve the
commander of the flag of truce&#8217;s promises and
if the hostages are not liberated before noon
to-morrow, the allied fleet would bombard the
city. This has thrown the viceroy into a
fever of fear, for he owns much valuable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
property in and about the city. He has
given the general orders to open fire on the
fleet if it again moves to an anchorage off the
city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will he obey the order?&#8221; Phil asked
eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He must,&#8221; Emmons replied. &#8220;He dare
not refuse a direct order from the viceroy,
but he has demanded this order in writing, so
as to protect himself when the day of reckoning
comes. General Hang-Ki has sent a
memorial to the viceroy protesting against
this action; he realizes that these gunboats
stand for many great battle-ships that would
be sent against his forts as soon as the spring
floods bring rising water in the Yangtse
River.&#8221;</p>

<p>The midshipmen were silent, while Emmons
spoke to the general. The conversation
lasted for several minutes, when finally the
former again spoke in his father&#8217;s language.</p>

<p>&#8220;The viceroy is ignorant of our presence
here and we must soon leave you. If Ta-Ling
should discover that we had talked with
you, all hope for you would be over.&#8221;</p>

<p>The midshipmen were cast down into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
depths of despair. Then they were not to be
liberated at all, and would again go back to
their prison and be in the cruel clutches of
that fiend Ta-Ling.</p>

<p>&#8220;The general has done his best to arrange
an escape,&#8221; were the cheering words from
Emmons. &#8220;To-night you will be put in a
cell away from the Chinese prisoners. The
door of the cell will be unlocked. Here is a
plan of the yamen, and I have marked your
route to the gate and safety. I shall have
chairs waiting you at the gate. Success depends
upon yourselves; we dare not help you
farther. In this room marked in pencil you
will find mandarin robes, which you must
put on. The guards throughout the yamen
will be removed until midnight, so you must
succeed before that time. The room in which
you will find disguises is occupied by the
viceroy&#8217;s treasurer. He is a close friend of
Ta-Ling and cannot be bought. If you are
discovered the general will be powerless to
save you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Langdon?&#8221; Phil asked earnestly,
his heart beating high with hope. &#8220;We cannot
go a step without him and our four sailors.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>&#8220;That is more difficult,&#8221; Emmons replied
with annoyance. &#8220;He is being constantly
visited by Ta-Ling. To attempt his
escape may defeat all. The four sailors are
in another part of the yamen and except for
cruel treatment are safe for the present. The
general is grateful to you for revealing this
plot against his own life, but his real intention
is to give your captain information as to
what will happen if he attempts to run by the
forts. There is, however, a channel, known to
only the Chinese, leading behind and close to
the long narrow island on the opposite side of
the river. This island is now covered with
tall reed grass which will conceal the hulls of
the gunboats from the rays of the search-lights
of the fort. Here is a sketch plan of
this channel. If your commander will start
at night and use the channel I suggest, it
may be that he can take his entire fleet past
the forts undiscovered. I dare not take this
message myself, for my movements are
closely watched. I fear even now Ta-Ling
may have discovered our purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can we depend upon this information?&#8221;
Sydney whispered to Phil, as Emmons and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
the general rose to their feet. &#8220;Might it not
be a trick to blow the gunboats up by mines
in this narrow channel?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil put the question to Emmons, but the
latter assured them of the honesty of the general.</p>

<p>&#8220;The general believes he is serving his
country in giving this information,&#8221; he added;
&#8220;he knows his people will suffer through the
viceroy&#8217;s treachery. If the fleet can pass
without being discovered, he cannot be held
guilty of disobeying the order of the viceroy.
So you see it is important that this message
should reach your captain in time to prevent
him from carrying out his threat of running
the batteries.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reluctantly the midshipmen agreed to leave
Langdon and the four sailors behind and
make the attempt to escape in order to carry
the information of the secret channel to
Commander Hughes. Each felt that in
doing so they might be sacrificing their
friend to the revenge of Ta-Ling when he
had discovered the absence of the midshipmen,
but the good of the cause demanded it
be so.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>In but a few moments the jailer led the
lads back to their distasteful prison.</p>

<p>Passing a great tub of clear water, both
lads looked longingly at it and then at their
soiled hands. To their delight the Chinaman
smiled and motioned that they might indulge
in a bath.</p>

<p>Delightedly the lads stripped their unclean
clothes from their bodies and bathed in the
soothing water. Forgetful of their surroundings,
with the complacent jailer sitting close
by an amused spectator, they talked gayly of
their hoped-for deliverance. Then the bright
smiles on their faces were suddenly frozen
by the sound of a voice which they had
learned to dread.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem very cheerful for men who are
soon to be executed,&#8221; Ta-Ling said in his
perfect English. &#8220;What has put my good
friends in such excellent spirits?&#8221;</p>

<p>Both midshipmen were speechless with astonishment.
How long had this eavesdropper
been listening? Had he discovered the intrigue
of the Tartar general? These were the
questions that passed through their minds.
They waited in cruel suspense for the next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
words of their enemy to answer these fateful
questions.</p>

<p>Ta-Ling turned upon the trembling jailer,
berating him soundly, punctuating his words
with kicks and blows which the cringing man
received without a sign of resentment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have told him that if I saw you laughing
again,&#8221; he cried angrily, &#8220;he would
have his head chopped off. Your treatment
here has been too kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then as an afterthought the mandarin
picked up Phil&#8217;s uniform blouse from the
ground at his feet and searched through the
pockets carefully. Phil was terrified; the
plan of the yamen was in his trousers pocket
on the ground at the Chinaman&#8217;s feet. If he
searched through his trousers, all hope of
escape would be ended.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />


<small>A DARING PLAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ta-Ling</span> threw down the coat impatiently
and glanced disdainfully at the other articles
of apparel. He then took up Phil&#8217;s muddy
trousers gingerly as if fearful of soiling his
esthetic hands. The lad&#8217;s heart was in his
throat while he watched the Chinaman guardedly,
striving to appear unconcerned, and
cudgeling his brain for something to say in
order to turn the man&#8217;s attention from a search
of the guilty garment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are you so bitter against my people?&#8221;
Phil asked hoarsely. &#8220;Were you not educated
in America?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ta-Ling dropped the tattered garment,
glancing up quickly, a scowl on his yellow
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why am I bitter against you?&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;I despise everything American.
Was I not put in a pen in San Francisco
along with such cattle as coolies from Japan,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
Corea and my own country? Your stupid
officials claimed not to be able to distinguish
between us. I heard one say &#8216;All Chinks
look alike to me.&#8217; After the first experience,
when I was washed and my clothes fumigated
as if I had been a pauper immigrant, I got
letters from college friends, but armed even
with these I suffered indignities at the hands of
these ignorant officials. When I left America
with my graduation diploma in my pocket I
took oath to my father&#8217;s spirit that I would
consecrate my life to making foreigners respect
the persons of the high class Chinese, and in
starting this crusade I saw it was first necessary
to drive all foreigners out of our sacred
country.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both midshipmen were astonished at the
earnestness in Ta-Ling&#8217;s voice. If the situation
had been reversed, would they have
acted differently? Had not this man ample
reason to hate all foreigners?</p>

<p>&#8220;Even if some of our stupidly ignorant
and irresponsible officials could not distinguish
between ranks in your society,&#8221; Phil
urged, &#8220;why should you revenge yourself
against us? We are innocent of all blame.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
We came into your city under the sacred
protection of a flag of truce, and in committing
a crime against us you will only confirm
foreigners in their belief that a Chinaman
is not worthy of considerate treatment.
Your cause will not be benefited, and your
people will suffer; the allied fleet will avenge
our deaths as was done in Peking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do I care how many of these low-caste
dogs die?&#8221; Ta-Ling retorted scornfully;
&#8220;there are over four hundred million of such
animals. Your deaths will force the foreign
governments to wage war on China, and once
this war is begun, our people will rise up
from one end of the empire to the other
to drive the foreigner from the soil of
China.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the missionaries, who have at heart
only the enlightenment of your people,&#8221;
Phil urged, catching his clothes stealthily
from the ground at Ta-Ling&#8217;s feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;They, of all the foreigners who come to
China,&#8221; the Chinaman returned somewhat
shamefacedly, &#8220;are working unselfishly, but
they must suffer with the others; all foreigners
must go for China&#8217;s good.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>&#8220;I tell you these things,&#8221; he ended, turning
to leave the midshipmen with their jailer,
&#8220;because your death-warrants have already
been signed by the viceroy. At the first hostile
shot fired by the allies your heads will
pay the forfeit and we shall attack the mission,
guarded now by your sailors, and kill
every foreigner within.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Ta-Ling left them, the jailer seized the
lads roughly and dragged them toward their
cell. As the door closed behind them Phil
shuddered at the demoniacal laughs of derision
from their fellow prisoners.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our cause has a bitter enemy in Ta-Ling,&#8221;
Phil whispered, after the lads had been sitting
on their hard wooden bench for several
minutes and the noise from their prison
mates had subsided; &#8220;but I believe he&#8217;ll fail.
When Commander Hughes commences to
throw his shells into the city, he&#8217;ll be one of
the first, with all his vain show of patriotism,
to cry enough and seek safety.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney did not reply; his thoughts were
upon the coming night, when the two midshipmen
were to make their dash for freedom.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>After a few minutes he confided his fears
to his friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Ta-Ling finds that we have talked with
the Tartar general we&#8217;re as good as dead men,&#8221;
he said in an awed whisper.</p>

<p>This terrible thought sent a shiver through
Phil.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you notice the look on the jailer&#8217;s
face when Ta-Ling was talking to him?&#8221;
he continued in an anxious voice; &#8220;it was
one of cringing fear. If Ta-Ling even suspects
that we had been out of our cell and
questions that man he will tell all. The jailer
probably is keen enough to know that Hang-Ki
and Ta-Ling are enemies, and of the two
he fears the latter most.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the die is cast,&#8221; Phil answered,
smiling with a great effort; &#8220;there&#8217;s no use
crying over it. We are either going to escape
to-night or we are going to have our heads
chopped off out there in the courtyard. Nothing
that we can do can alter our fate, so we
might just as well look cheerful, even though
we don&#8217;t feel that way,&#8221; and suiting his actions
to his words he began to whistle the
class march.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>Sydney sat mournfully listening, while the
Chinese criminals crowded around them,
jabbering noisily.</p>

<p>The hours dragged wearily along. As the
light through the barred door became dimmer,
foretelling the end of the tedious day,
the midshipmen&#8217;s hopes rose; so far Ta-Ling
could not have learned of their visit to his
enemy.</p>

<p>The midshipmen were taken out into the
courtyard as usual for their evening meal
and after the meagre fare had been eaten
with great effort by the anxious and impatient
lads, the jailer removed their irons and
washed carefully the aching sore on Sydney&#8217;s
wrist.</p>

<p>Phil was delighted to see that the man had
recovered from his fear of a few hours ago,
and that he lingered a much longer time
than seemed necessary, for Sydney&#8217;s wrist had
been securely bound with Phil&#8217;s handkerchief
and appeared to be healing, auguring well for
the success of the coming night.</p>

<p>It was quite dark when the jailer had
finished his solicitous attentions, and replaced
the irons on their feet and hands. Motioning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
the midshipmen to follow him, he led them
along the stone flagging of the courtyard, cautioning
silence by raising his hand and shaking
his head jerkily. Loaded down as they
were with heavy chains, to move quietly was
not an easy task, and was one calculated to
fatigue the lads to an alarming extent after their
two days of cruel torture in these steel bonds.</p>

<p>After traversing nearly half the length of
the courtyard, the jailer suddenly threw open
a door, and forcefully pushed them through
it into darkness. The door closed quietly behind
his retreating figure.</p>

<p>Their hearts beating fast, Phil and Sydney
strained their ears to catch the first sound of
alarm. Heavy footfalls approaching on the
stone pavement soon told them the reason of
the jailer&#8217;s haste and his sudden departure.</p>

<p>Holding their breath tightly, they heard
the newcomer stop hesitatingly before the
door of their cell, then after a second he
moved farther along, and finally the opening
and shutting of a door told them he had
entered a room near or even next to the one
in which the two midshipmen had been so
suddenly thrust.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>Sounds of a low-pitched voice came distinctly
to their ears through the frail partition;
the lads listened eagerly. Then the bold
tones of Langdon&#8217;s voice sounded distinctly.</p>

<p>&#8220;For a man who was educated among
white men,&#8221; he was saying in a scornful voice,
&#8220;you seem to have a queer idea of our honesty.
If you liberate all, I&#8217;ll take the letter to our
captain, but I shall not tell him I believe the
viceroy will play fair, for I don&#8217;t believe he
will. I don&#8217;t trust him, nor you. Send the
letter by one of your own people, and see
what answer he&#8217;ll send back. The threat that
at the first gun fired by the allies our heads
will be chopped off will not affect his plans.
What are two midshipmen, four sailors, and
a pilot to a country like ours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Commander Ignacio and two of the allied
gunboats have accepted the viceroy&#8217;s word
and are back at their old anchorage,&#8221; Ta-Ling&#8217;s
voice urged. &#8220;That shows the viceroy&#8217;s
good faith.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk to me of that traitor,&#8221; Langdon
exclaimed; &#8220;he isn&#8217;t white anyway; his skin
is as yellow as yours.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>&#8220;Then you refuse your life?&#8221; Ta-Ling&#8217;s
voice asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;You Chinese are a soft-brained lot,&#8221;
Langdon said, ignoring the question; &#8220;your
intrigue is as plain as children&#8217;s play. Men
like Ignacio might be fooled. I don&#8217;t know
what promises you&#8217;ve made to him. Probably
offered to give his countrymen the railroad
concession to Peking, which your viceroy has
cheated the Americans out of by his underhand
dealings; but you ought to know after
four years at an American college that we are
not that kind. Commander Hughes is in
this river to see that Americans are left unmolested,
in accordance with the treaties
made between the two countries.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you know that when I was in
your America I personally investigated nearly
a score of murders of Chinese in what you
call the West. Each case was as brutal and
flagrant as any that has occurred in China,&#8221;
Ta-Ling&#8217;s voice broke in triumphantly.
&#8220;How then can you boast of the honesty of
your people?&mdash;for in not a single instance
were the murderers punished.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because you Chinese are a weak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
race, and haven&#8217;t the back-bone to stand up
for your rights,&#8221; Langdon replied, &#8220;while
we are men enough to insist on fair treatment
for our citizens abroad. That&#8217;s where you are
lacking in national character.&#8221;</p>

<p>A rattle of chains and harsh cries of rage
and pain followed the sally of Langdon,
causing the listeners to hold themselves rigid
with suppressed excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;That beast!&#8221; Phil whispered. &#8220;I wish
I had let him drown.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go to your midshipmen friends,&#8221; Ta-Ling
said sullenly. &#8220;I believe they are
frightened enough to be bought by the price
you refuse. Remember, I&#8217;ve given you the last
chance you&#8217;ll get.&#8221;</p>

<p>Langdon was apparently too angry to speak.
The lads could hear distinctly his heavy
breathing, caused by some torture administered
by this cruel Chinaman.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re trying to hedge, is that it?&#8221; the
thick voice of the pilot was heard to say; &#8220;or
do you count upon catching the gunboats unawares
as they steam by the forts flying flags
of truce?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Chinaman administered a vicious kick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
in answer, and the lads held their breath in
almost a panic as they heard the door of
Langdon&#8217;s cell close and Ta-Ling&#8217;s footsteps
die slowly away down the courtyard.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all up with us,&#8221; Sydney breathed
hopelessly. &#8220;He&#8217;ll soon find we are not in
our prison, and then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he ended with a
shiver as his thoughts dwelt upon the terrible
death by decapitation.</p>

<p>A loud clank made the overwrought midshipmen
start terrified; then Phil fairly
gasped with surprise and joy; his arm manacles
had fallen to the ground.</p>

<p>In the darkness he quickly reached out
and grasped Sydney&#8217;s hand, fingering nervously
the cruel iron bracelets. The metal
rings were clamped but unlocked, and he
readily removed the irons from his companion&#8217;s
hands. In but a moment more they
both stood free of their retaining bonds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ta-Ling and the jailer,&#8221; Phil whispered
as a sound of approaching footsteps became
audible. &#8220;If they enter here we must overpower
them. It&#8217;s our one chance now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney moved closer to Phil, taking his
hand in silence, and pressing it in sign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
of his readiness to follow his friend&#8217;s
lead.</p>

<p>&#8220;They must make no outcry,&#8221; Phil continued.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll take the one nearest me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Chinamen stopped at the cell door,
and the voice of Ta-Ling was raised angrily,
storming in Chinese at the jailer, apparently
for daring to remove the prisoners from their
former cell.</p>

<p>The midshipmen retreated until their backs
touched the wall of the narrow cell, having
replaced their hand irons to appear to be still
in chains.</p>

<p>A dim light shone into their cell as the
door swung loudly open, and the scowling
face of Ta-Ling appeared, with the jailer behind
him, timidly holding up an oil lantern.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you didn&#8217;t like to be kept with the
rest of the cattle?&#8221; Ta-Ling&#8217;s cruel voice began.
Then he stopped suddenly, and threw
up his head with a wicked laugh. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
heard Langdon&#8217;s answer, then?&#8221; he continued,
signing to the terrified and trembling
jailer to put down the lantern on the solitary
wooden bench. The man entered the cell to
obey, leaving the door open.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>Phil saw the time had come for action.
He sought Sydney&#8217;s eye, then stealthily
moved his foot, quietly throwing the door off
its balance, allowing it to swing slowly closed.
He had purposely moved so that Ta-Ling in
addressing him must turn his back upon
Sydney and the jailer. Burning with excitement
he watched Sydney grasp his hand
irons firmly. The great bulk of the jailer
loomed almost grotesquely in the light of the
flickering lantern. Fearing that Ta-Ling
might be attracted by the eagerness which he
was powerless to hide, Phil lowered his gaze,
but out of the tail of his eye he was conscious
that the iron flashed in the lamplight
as the click of the shutting door
caused the interpreter to glance toward it suspiciously.</p>

<p>Then a rattle of chain and a dull sound behind
him made Ta-Ling swing suddenly
around. Phil&#8217;s opportunity had arrived.
With fingers itching for this cruel Chinaman&#8217;s
throat he sprang upon him, smothering
the cry that was ready to give the alarm
to the yamen guard, and bore him heavily to
the ground. In the flickering light he saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
the man&#8217;s face turn livid, then purple, while
his muscles relaxed. Glancing up, he saw
Sydney removing a great bunch of keys from
the prostrate body of the jailer.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br />


<small>HOPES OF ESCAPE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ta-Ling</span> had ceased to struggle; his eyes
protruded in ghastly fashion, while through
his open mouth his tongue showed blue and
swollen. Phil was terrified at the sight, believing
he had killed the Chinaman, but upon
opening his coat he felt his heart beating
faintly.</p>

<p>With a sigh of great relief he rose to his
feet and, taking the lantern in his hand, he
scanned his prostrate victim.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must put on his clothes and release
Langdon,&#8221; Sydney whispered, holding the
keys out toward Phil.</p>

<p>Without a word, but with fingers trembling
with excitement, the lad stooped down, stripping
the robes from the inanimate form; the
baggy trousers, the silken hose and satin
shoes and the long flowing robe with the
mandarin square of the scholar embroidered
in gold on its front.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>Discarding his naval uniform he hastily
put on his enemy&#8217;s garments. When completely
clothed he turned to Sydney, who
gasped with astonishment at the altered appearance
of his friend. The hat with its horsetail
plume and pink button concealed his
long front hair which in a Chinaman is always
missing, being shaved close to his scalp.</p>

<p>Sydney immediately followed his comrade&#8217;s
example and was soon arrayed in the costume
of the Chinese jailer.</p>

<p>Phil pointed to their discarded irons and
in a few moments they had snapped feet and
hand manacles over the helpless limbs of Ta-Ling.
Then they both turned impatiently
toward the door. Phil hesitated for an instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;They may come to before we can make
our escape,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We must gag them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stripping their prisoners of their undergarments,
these as gags were tied firmly over their
mouths.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope he doesn&#8217;t smother,&#8221; Phil whispered
in some alarm; &#8220;he seems to be hardly
breathing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t take any chances now,&#8221; Sydney<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
returned calmly; &#8220;it&#8217;s their life or ours. If
we are caught now nothing can save us.&#8221;</p>

<p>To make more sure of their prisoners, the
arms of each were bound to their sides, so
that upon regaining consciousness they could
not work their gags off their mouths and give
the alarm to the yamen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope they&#8217;ll be found before they starve
to death,&#8221; Phil said anxiously. &#8220;I fear the
jailer will feel that we are ungrateful for his
aid. I don&#8217;t dare liberate him; he may in fear
betray us into the hands of the guard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll surely be found in the morning,&#8221;
Sydney assured him. &#8220;Our friends the
prisoners will clamor when their breakfast
doesn&#8217;t appear, and then a search will be made
for him and for us too. If we are not found
before,&#8221; he ended grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this!&#8221; Phil exclaimed, drawing
from the inside pocket of his Chinese coat a
number of papers and examining them in the
light of the lantern. &#8220;A telegram!&#8221; he cried,
&#8220;and addressed to Commander Hughes!&#8221;</p>

<p>Both lads gazed at the sealed envelope as if
they would like to bore through the outer
covering and read the message within.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>&#8220;Dare we open it?&#8221; Phil asked. &#8220;If it is
in the ordinary cipher I know the key word.
It may be something important, and as
well for us to know the contents if we lose the
telegram. And here is a letter addressed to
the captain,&#8221; he continued excitedly. &#8220;This
is surely the one which Ta-Ling tempted
Langdon to take. But come,&#8221; he added
hastily, &#8220;we must not allow him to be a
minute longer in his chains.&#8221;</p>

<p>Taking the keys from Sydney&#8217;s hand, he
opened the cell door and led the way to the
door of Langdon&#8217;s prison. There was no
sound in the enclosure except an occasional
shrill cry from the prisoners at the far corner.
As they waited in the silent courtyard to
make sure all was well before entering, Langdon&#8217;s
heavy breathing came distinctly to their
ears.</p>

<p>After a few seconds Phil selected the right
key and the next moment the door swung
open, while the lad whispered softly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Langdon!&#8221;</p>

<p>But there was no answer; then the dim
light shed its fitful rays about the dungeon
and the lad gave a smothered cry of concern,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
for the sight which met his gaze was indeed
appalling: Langdon, bound tightly, was triced
up to a beam overhead by his feet and the
iron ring about his neck, and he was by
degrees strangling to death.</p>

<p>The anxious lads quickly cut the ropes and
lowered the insensible man to the floor. Then
removing the irons they worked over him
anxiously while the time passed on winged
feet. Finally the pilot opened his eyes and
stared at the lads with angry, sullen eyes,
making a futile attempt to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;You miserable coward,&#8221; he finally managed
to say in a thick whisper. &#8220;I hope some
day you&#8217;ll be treated as you&#8217;ve treated me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The midshipmen were at first so taken
aback that they were silent. Then the
comical part of the tragedy appealed to them
and in that instant Langdon recognized his
rescuers.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got him now in almost the same
condition that you were in,&#8221; Phil whispered.</p>

<p>The pilot gazed in wonder at the midshipmen.
Raising a trembling hand he passed it
over his eyes uncertainly, as if he would
sweep away the delusion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>&#8220;What does it mean?&#8221; he asked weakly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It means that we are for the time free,&#8221;
Phil answered; &#8220;but come, we must start. If
we delay Ta-Ling may be missed and a search
for him would spoil all. Can you walk?&#8221;
he asked solicitously.</p>

<p>&#8220;In a minute,&#8221; the pilot replied. &#8220;Help
me to my feet. I&#8217;d have been gone in a half
hour more,&#8221; he added, feeling his sore and
swollen throat.</p>

<p>The lads helped him to his feet and he
stood unsteadily, leaning his great weight on
their shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was partly our fault,&#8221; Sydney said
apologetically; &#8220;he no doubt intended coming
back and lowering you; but we couldn&#8217;t
allow him to leave our cell.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a few minutes more to permit Langdon
to regain his strength and give the blood
a chance to circulate into his cramped limbs,
Phil made the motion to follow, and all three
noiselessly filed out into the courtyard and
entered the cell where the Chinamen were
lying.</p>

<p>The interpreter&#8217;s breathing showed that he
would soon regain his senses. Langdon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
glared triumphantly down upon the villain
who would gladly kill all the foreigners
within the Chinese Empire.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not half gagged,&#8221; he exclaimed in a
hoarse whisper. Then he untied the gag
which the lads had made and jammed the
mandarin&#8217;s mouth full of his own clothing,
binding it in with a tight bandage. After
rearranging the jailer&#8217;s gag, he arose and
gloated over the fallen favorite of the viceroy.</p>

<p>Phil had torn open the telegram and in the
dim light scanned it anxiously. Then he
drew from his pocket a pencil and in silence
wrote the key word above the words of the
message. Sydney regarded him in a fever of
excitement. Finally Phil&#8217;s pencil was still
and he looked up with a white, anxious face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to destroy it, but I don&#8217;t dare,&#8221;
he said. Then he read in a voice trembling
with emotion:</p>

<p>&#8220;Department condemns your actions in
entering To-Yan Lake and attacking Chinese
soldiers. Proceed immediately back to Ku-Ling
and offer ample apology to viceroy.
Consider yourself relieved of your command.&#8221;</p>

<p>If a shell had exploded in their midst the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
eager listeners could not have been more surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Burn it up,&#8221; Langdon exclaimed indignantly.
&#8220;That&#8217;s the way things are run
from a distance of ten thousand miles.&#8221;
Then his glance encountered the wide-open
eyes of Ta-Ling and he snorted with rage as
he roughly jerked the bound Chinaman to his
feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you hear it?&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>The mandarin&#8217;s eyes burned balefully as
he nodded his head in assent. Langdon released
the Chinaman, and but for Phil&#8217;s steadying
hand he would have fallen to the floor.
Then the pilot raised the long braided cue of
the interpreter and with a swift cut of his
jack-knife severed it close up to the Chinaman&#8217;s
head; the next second, holding it out to
Phil, he cried gleefully:</p>

<p>&#8220;Put this on under your cap; it&#8217;s all you
need to complete your costume.</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t be so keen to show yourself in
public hereafter,&#8221; he continued spitefully to
the mandarin.</p>

<p>Ta-Ling was beside himself with rage, but
he could only grow red and utter inarticulate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
sounds, while Langdon sat on the wooden
bench laughing scornfully at the disgraced
official.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he doesn&#8217;t commit suicide in twenty-four
hours, it&#8217;s because he&#8217;s chicken-hearted.&#8221;
Langdon laughed in a low tone, mainly for
the Chinaman&#8217;s ear. The pilot knew he held
the secret of the cablegram. Apparently he
had guessed at the contents and was going to
send it together with the letter for the American
captain. If the viceroy knew the stand
that was being taken by the American government,
every missionary in the valley of the
Yangtse would be unsafe. The mandarin
officials in the towns of the provinces were as
yet guarding the foreigners against attack until
they could be sure of the outcome at Ku-Ling.
Once the viceroy had humbled the foreign
pride then the rabble would be free to
indulge its aroused hatred.</p>

<p>Phil cut short the pilot&#8217;s mirth by taking
him by the arm and leading him silently to
the door. Once outside the cell the lad
showed him the sketch plan of the yamen
with the path they must take to reach the
room where clothes would be found.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>&#8220;If we only knew where the sailors are,&#8221;
Sydney whispered.</p>

<p>Phil shook his head. It might only defeat
them, and the sailors would be no better off.</p>

<p>Langdon for the first time realized that he
was not in the plot and would have asked many
questions, but Phil and Sydney grasped him
firmly on each side as if he were their prisoner
and marched openly down the stone
pavement of the courtyard. The place indicated
on the sketch was easily found and Phil,
leaving his companions, pushed the door
quietly open. The room was lighted by a
single swinging lamp, while in one corner sat
a Chinaman reckoning laboriously on his
abacus, a counting device used by the Oriental
races; the click of the small wooden balls
as he moved them along their wires sounded
distinctly in the quiet of the room.</p>

<p>As Phil closed the door softly behind him
the Chinaman glanced up casually, speaking
a few words in his guttural tongue. The lad
made no reply, but glanced about hastily to
make sure those near could not discover what
was about to happen. His heart was beating
fast. He saw a door beyond the victim which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
he knew must lead directly into the viceroy&#8217;s
own apartments; voices, almost inaudible,
came to his ears from the rooms on the other
side of that slender partition. He saw that
he must work quickly and silently. Any
moment the door might open and he would
be discovered, for his disguise would be useless
under the direct gaze of a Chinese mandarin.
The treasurer had seen him but indistinctly
and had taken for granted that he was
Ta-Ling.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_190.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><i>HE MEASURED THE STRENGTH<br />
OF HIS ANTAGONIST</i></p>

<p>Moving silently to the side of the absorbed
Chinaman, Phil stood for the fraction of a
second looking down on his work. His eyes
sought out the curve of the neck in its
enveloping robe while he measured the
strength of his antagonist. Raising his hands
in readiness, he poised them aloft ready to grasp
the slender neck within his muscular fingers.</p>

<p>As if by premonition of the danger threatening
him, the Chinaman dropped his hands
from the abacus and glanced swiftly up into
Phil&#8217;s face. The next second the midshipman&#8217;s
hands had encircled his neck and the
terrified outcry which the lad saw in his
frightened eyes was stifled.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>&#8220;Hurry, Langdon!&#8221; Phil whispered over
his shoulder, as the pilot noiselessly entered to
dress himself in one of the many robes hanging
about the room.</p>

<p>While Phil slowly reduced the treasurer to
a harmless state, the pilot made a hasty
change, and as the lads had done, rolled his
own clothes in a bundle, concealing them under
his flowing robe.</p>

<p>With articles of clothing the Americans
silently bound and gagged the treasurer and
laid his body away, hidden from the view of
the casual observer entering the room; then
the three proceeded to carry out the last and
most trying stage of their perilous adventure.</p>

<p>Phil leading, they arrived in sight of the
outer gate. So far no guards had been met, but
now with sinking heart Phil saw a large
crowd gathered on the outside of the open
gateway. Soldiers, their muskets in hand,
stood stolidly on guard, while others sat on
the ground, chattering volubly. Was this
but the usual crowd always seen at the gates
of a Chinese yamen&mdash;the poor awaiting
crumbs from the rich man&#8217;s table? Overhead
several oil lanterns shed their meagre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
light upon the assemblage. The score or
more of Chinese would surely penetrate their
disguise! He saw Langdon raise his hand
with its flowing sleeve to his face, and quickly
imitated the movement, nudging Sydney to
do likewise.</p>

<p>A hoarse cry rang out from the guard at
the gate as they approached, which sent chills
of terror down the lad&#8217;s spine. His first inclination
was to turn and flee back into the
yamen and he stopped so abruptly that Sydney
trod on his heels. What were the men
at the gate calling to each other?</p>

<small>THE ESCAPE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> the moment the midshipmen were sure
that they had been discovered. Then Langdon&#8217;s
low voice reassured them:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, it&#8217;s all right. They take us for
mandarins, and are calling the guard to &#8216;attention.&#8217;
Keep your sleeves over your faces
and don&#8217;t look up as we pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the Americans were in motion toward
the lighted gateway. With hearts beating
high, in a terrible suspense, their feet mechanically
carried them slowly toward the
spot where they would be under the fire of a
scrutiny of scores of people whose nationality
the Americans were endeavoring to counterfeit.
Would not the Chinese see through
their flimsy disguise? As the escaping men
passed the first guard, he raised his rifle
smartly to the &#8220;present&#8221; in salute, but the
quick motion struck terror to Phil&#8217;s heart,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
making him jump aside involuntarily as if he
were dodging an expected blow. Shamefacedly
the lad recovered himself by a great
effort. In a moment more the gateway was
passed and the Americans found themselves
on the edge of the inquisitive crowd.</p>

<p>Langdon raised his hand, and immediately
three chairs were brought by coolies from the
edge of the narrow street and placed obediently
on the ground before them. Phil
longed to be within the shadow of the chair
canopies. How could these Chinamen be so
easily deceived! As he fairly dived into the
friendly darkness of the nearest chair he cast
a swift, uneasy glance at the crowd. The
reason of their immunity was plain. The eyes
of the crowd were directed upon the ground
for fear in the presence of their all-powerful
rulers.</p>

<p>Langdon gave a brief order in Chinese.
With high hopes for success Phil felt his
chair borne upward to the muscular shoulders
of the coolie carriers and then with loud
shouts of warning to the crowd to make way,
they started off in a long, swinging walk. Phil
drew his curtains tightly shut and lay back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
with a great sigh of relief in his cushioned
seat.</p>

<p>They were out of the yamen at last, but the
city gate must yet be passed. If their absence
were discovered while they were yet within
the walled city their recapture was assured.</p>

<p>Although the coolies traveled at a lively
pace, it seemed to the anxious Americans that
they were but crawling through the deserted
streets; the Chinese on account of the lateness
of the hour were all within their hovel-like
houses. An occasional soldier, clanking a
chain loudly to frighten away demons, and
calling out in his harsh language that all was
well, brought a sudden shock to Phil&#8217;s high-strung
nerves.</p>

<p>At last the gate of the city was reached and
the chairs stopped. Through his bamboo
screen Phil saw that the guards were hesitating
about opening the gate. Once a gate
was closed an order from the viceroy alone
could open it between the setting and rising of
the sun.</p>

<p>An officer came forward, peering inside the
protecting hoods. Phil believed that all was
lost as he felt, even in the gloom of his chair,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
the scrutinizing gaze upon him. The officer
spoke a few words, and the lad realized by
the rising inflection in the man&#8217;s voice that
he was asking a question. The midshipman
nodded and raising his hand pointed
haughtily to the gate.</p>

<p>Then to his joy the officer withdrew his
head as if satisfied and gave an order in a
loud voice. Immediately the gate swung
open and with a rattle of rusty chain the
drawbridge was lowered.</p>

<p>Quickly the Americans were carried through
the gate and across the moat. They had left the
terrors of the walled city and were now upon
the neutral ground of the foreign concession.
As they passed over the wide streets, in great
contrast to the ill-kept, narrow ones of the
Chinese city, the pungent odors of the docks
struck pleasantly upon their nostrils.</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s chair was still in the lead, and the
Chinese carriers, as if acting under instructions,
trudged steadily onward to the &#8220;Bund,&#8221;
the street paralleling the water front. Finally
the coolies halted, putting the chairs down for
the occupants to alight. Phil disentangled
himself from the enshrouding curtains and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
stood on the broad street, joyfully inhaling the
fresh air of the river, while Langdon waved
the coolies to be gone.</p>

<p>Once alone the Americans were at liberty
to talk. Phil told in as few words as possible
of their visit to Emmons and the Tartar
general.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Emmons?&#8221; Langdon exclaimed
irritably. &#8220;We&#8217;re in as much danger as ever
here. The foreigners have all fled. The
concession is deserted, and doubtless the streets
are full of robbers who would very cheerfully
pitch us into the river for the sake of a few
Mexican dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil was about to disclaim any knowledge
of the whereabouts of the half-breed, when
Sydney&#8217;s exclamation of surprise drew his
attention to three small gunboats anchored
in the river but a short distance away, and the
bright lights of a steam launch approaching
the jetty from one of their dark hulls.</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s heart was filled with joy. Here at
last was safety!</p>

<p>The three men hastened gladly to the landing
at which the launch had arrived, while
Phil stepped forward to accost an officer who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
had hastily left the launch and was approaching
up the ladder from the landing float
below.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are late,&#8221; the newcomer said irritably.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been watching the landing for over an
hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil was about to reply, but something
which he could not explain held his tongue,
for he recognized instantly the voice of
Ignacio.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are your chairs?&#8221; Commander Ignacio
continued; &#8220;you can hardly expect me to
walk through the dirty streets of your ill-smelling
city, even for the pleasure of seeing that
young braggart tortured in true Chinese fashion.
You see I am not entirely confident of
you and your viceroy, so I have brought along
a few companions;&#8221; he pointed toward the float,
where eight or ten sailors had disembarked
from the launch, rifles in hand.</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s tongue clove to the top of his mouth
at the suddenness of their dilemma. What
should he do? Ignacio had said too much
now to cover his tracks, and his sailors would
undoubtedly obey his orders, even to killing
three innocent Americans in cold blood.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>&#8220;Come, what are we waiting for?&#8221; the
foreigner added, grasping Phil&#8217;s arm, and
turning him away from the river. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
want to lose all my sleep; it&#8217;s nearly ten o&#8217;clock
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s companions stood by speechless.
Even Langdon with all his sang froid was at
a loss what to do. To reveal their true character
to their enemy would mean that at the
least he would take them forcibly back to the
viceroy. Phil at the Naval Academy had
been declared a fine mimic and in the class
minstrel shows he had to the delight of the
brigade caricatured and impersonated each of
the officers on duty at the school. Could he
impersonate Ta-Ling? Was it possible to
imitate his voice and the peculiar pronunciation
of the English words? It was their only
hope. Even if he failed, they could be no
worse off.</p>

<p>By a great effort he stilled the rapid heartbeats
and brought his trembling voice under
control.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was detained by his Excellency the
viceroy,&#8221; he began in a voice that startled
even himself and made Langdon and Sydney<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
fairly jump with surprise and glance hastily
around for the owner of that despised voice;
&#8220;but if you are now ready we can start. The
chairs are up the street only a short distance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Commander Ignacio voiced his willingness
and the two men in the lead, followed by
Sydney and the pilot, retraced their steps
toward the gate of the walled city.</p>

<p>&#8220;Send your men back to the ship,&#8221; Phil,
stopping suddenly, said in the voice of Ta-Ling.
&#8220;You know me well enough to know
that I have no wish to harm you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Commander Ignacio hesitated. Doubtless
he felt safer with a few trusty sailors between
himself and the treacherous Chinese.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you send my telegrams?&#8221; he asked
quickly; &#8220;and have any come from Washington
for that American pig?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yours were sent,&#8221; Phil answered promptly,
&#8220;but the American captain has received
none.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it will come, I&#8217;m sure, and then
after he is disgraced, I shall be chosen as the
leader of the allies,&#8221; the foreign captain said
boastfully; &#8220;but you must keep your part of
the contract and hold your people in check<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
until I can get the credit of quelling the disturbance.
Say a month before you kill these
flat-chested missionaries.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was our agreement,&#8221; Phil replied;
&#8220;now show that you have confidence in me
and send your men aboard.&#8221;</p>

<p>Commander Ignacio reluctantly left Phil&#8217;s
side and walked back to the landing float to
give his orders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t open your mouths!&#8221; Phil whispered
in a tense voice. &#8220;When his men are
once out of sight I&#8217;ll lead him to where he
thinks the chairs are waiting. When I raise
my hand, jump on him like a ton of brick.
The chairs we got were waiting for Ta-Ling and
they may now be waiting for him near here, so
we must be quiet about it. I noticed the coolies
were surprised when Langdon motioned them
to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil had barely finished his instructions
before Commander Ignacio rejoined him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve sent them back,&#8221; he said in a voice
that showed plainly his dislike at so doing,
&#8220;and ordered the launch to return and wait
for me. Have you the viceroy&#8217;s promise for
the railroad concession?&#8221; he ended covetously;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
&#8220;it means fifty thousand<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Mexican to
you when the deed is signed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s all fixed,&#8221; Phil replied, now
laughing inwardly at the success of his strategy,
as he saw the steam launch with the
sailors leave the float and head back to their
ship.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember your promise to make way
with those three Americans. Their government
will do nothing except demand satisfaction,&#8221;
the foreigner urged earnestly. &#8220;That
means a little money squeezed from the
viceroy&#8217;s hoarded savings and half a dozen cut-throats
beheaded in the presence of the
American representatives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you only asked that one of them be
executed,&#8221; Phil returned, aghast at his joke
on such a gruesome topic.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I might have said only one,&#8221;
Ignacio made answer; &#8220;he is the darker of
the two midshipmen; the one that dared rebuke
me at the council before the viceroy;
but the others know too much to go free.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time the party had left the docks
and were walking slowly up the street leading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
to the city gate. The street was in darkness.
The few lanterns had not been lighted
since the exodus of the foreigners, and as
they passed the large buildings, it was
plainly seen that the foreign concession had
been given over to pillage; the steps and
pavement in front were littered with articles
which could not easily be carried away by
the avaricious Chinamen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you a revolver?&#8221; Phil asked. &#8220;I
am not armed, and sometimes these robbers
are dangerous if they think they can get
money.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil wanted to know if Ignacio was armed.
He feared that in the struggle which was
soon to come a pistol might be accidentally
discharged, which would not only arouse the
Chinese guards at the gate scarcely a few
hundred yards away, but might bring a party
of sailors from Commander Ignacio&#8217;s ship.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, two; one in each pocket,&#8221; the foreigner
answered, shoving his hands in the
pockets of his naval tunic. &#8220;I always carry
them, and I can shoot through my coat from
the hip and hit every time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; Phil thought; &#8220;they&#8217;ll come in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
very handy for us before the night is
over.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were nearing a part of the street
which to the lad seemed the very place to
carry out his design to render harmless the
companion walking so confidently beside him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our chairs should be near here,&#8221; he said,
leading the way down a narrow alley behind
a great white building, the English Bank,
which Phil recognized as the scene of his first
encounter with Commander Ignacio. What
spot could be more fitting for this last encounter?
Then he continued: &#8220;What makes
you think a telegram will come from Washington
disgracing the American captain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The telegram you sent me this morning
was from my friend, the naval attach&eacute; in
Washington; he says it is already published
in the American paper,&#8221; Commander Ignacio
answered. &#8220;Everything is printed in the
newspapers in America, you know. They do
not understand there the military value of
secrecy, which is the fundamental basis of
diplomacy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil ground his teeth in rage and mortification.
He could have struck the man down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
for talking of his country and countrymen
so slurringly. Yet he could only acknowledge
that the man was but repeating what had
often been said in Europe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are the chairs?&#8221; Commander
Ignacio asked in some alarm, as they reached
the end of the alley and it was apparent that
the square, court-like space was empty. Phil
appeared to search the deeper shadows with
his eyes, at the same time making the guttural
call which he had heard used by Chinamen
calling to them a chair and coolies. Ignacio
still had one hand in his pocket and Phil felt
sure his nervous finger was on a trigger. The
lad racked his brain to devise some scheme to
get him off his guard. Even now his suspicions
might have been aroused.</p>

<p>Langdon and Sydney were close behind
their victim, doubtless watching eagerly for
the sign from Phil. Ignacio stood close to a
door, his right hand, which was no doubt encircling
the butt of a revolver, nearest the knob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Try that door,&#8221; Phil said in as careless
tones as he could command. &#8220;It&#8217;s rather
damp outside and they might have gone inside
to sleep.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>It apparently did not occur to the foreigner
that the great bulky chairs would not be taken
inside, and if the coolies were there the chairs
would have been plainly in evidence in the
court, for he unguardedly took his right hand
from his pocket and raised it to the doorknob.</p>

<p>Phil waited not a second, but raised his
hand quickly above his head. He saw the
bodies of Sydney and Langdon hurl themselves
upon the unguarded victim. Then the
door flew open inward and his heart stopped
beating with terror and dismay, while the
silence was broken by the loud report of a
pistol shot, accompanied by the most unearthly
yells he had ever heard.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br />


<small>AN ENEMY SILENCED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Langdon</span> and Sydney had so forcibly driven
their enemy to the ground that one of the
revolvers, which was cocked, had gone off, the
noise of the discharge reverberating through
the bare building in a most startling way.
Intent upon their work, the pilot had seized
the wrists of the foreign captain in an iron
grip, while Sydney quickly disarmed him.</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s heart stopped beating at the sight
which presented itself as the door swung wide
open. By the light of three or four dripping
candles, he saw a dozen Chinamen seated
about the floor of the room.</p>

<p>As the lad forced his way boldly into the
midst of the startled Chinamen, holding before
him a revolver taken from Sydney&#8217;s hand in
passing, the surprised Orientals threw themselves
face downward upon the floor, whining
piteously for mercy.</p>

<p>Leaving the disarmed foreigner to Sydney,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
Langdon quickly joined the other midshipman,
surrounded as he was by the cringing
and terror-stricken natives.</p>

<p>&#8220;Canton Chinamen,&#8221; he whispered; &#8220;these
must be Emmons&#8217; launch crews; but what are
they doing here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Langdon raised his voice, addressing the
terrified men. At the sound of their own
tongue a Chinaman raised himself tremblingly
from the floor, his fear giving place to joy as
he recognized the familiar voice of the pilot,
whom he had so frequently seen piloting ships
on the great river.</p>

<p>After a few minutes&#8217; conversation with the
native Langdon turned to Phil, drawing the
lad out of ear-shot of their helpless enemy lying
upon the floor with Sydney&#8217;s muscular weight
upon his chest.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks bad for us!&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;This man, Nam-Sing, is one of Emmons&#8217;
head men, and these men are his crew. A
mob this afternoon looted the foreign concession
and destroyed all of Emmons&#8217; launches,
butchering the Canton Chinese crews in cold
blood. The foreign gunboats, he says, looked
on and would not interfere. Emmons, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
thinks, was killed. These men took refuge
in the secret vaults of the bank, known by
Nam-Sing because he was for some years
employed here. Believing that all was quiet,
they were trying to muster up courage to
escape down the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil could have wept with disappointment.
On the threshold of safety, they found their
escape cut off. His mind sought for a way to
overcome the difficulties. Ignacio&#8217;s launch
was at the landing. Why could they not
overpower the crew and escape in it? But he
soon saw that this plan would be worse than
foolhardy. They could not expect to pass
the alert gunboat, and once alongside, the
strategy would be discovered. But what else
could be done? A junk was out of the
question, for the wind was contrary, blowing
up the river, and before they could hope to
pass the forts, daylight would reveal them
and the Chinese guns would soon make them
return and surrender or else they would be
sunk. The longer the Americans remained
on shore the smaller were the chances for
escape; it was but a matter of time before
their absence from the yamen would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
known. While the lad pondered wildly on a
method of escape he saw the Chinaman Nam-Sing
attract Langdon&#8217;s attention and then
fairly explode in a volley of excited words.</p>

<p>&#8220;He says that one of the launches is not so
badly damaged,&#8221; the pilot whispered to Phil.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a steam launch, but under the stern-boards
is a small gasoline engine, and he
thinks the mob did not destroy that, for it is
hidden from view.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; Phil exclaimed eagerly.
Then he cast an uncertain look at the captive
whom Sydney had bound hand and foot,
securing a gag in his mouth and muffling his
ears so that he could hear only the loudest
tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must leave him behind,&#8221; Langdon insisted
immediately, interpreting the glance.
&#8220;He must take his chances.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t dare leave him there,&#8221; Phil exclaimed.
&#8220;He might be killed by the
Chinese. No, the consequences would be too
serious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what are we to do?&#8221; the pilot asked
impatiently. &#8220;He would as soon stick a
knife in you if you were in his power.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>&#8220;I know,&#8221; Phil declared stoutly, &#8220;but I
am going to get him on board his own ship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how on earth can you?&#8221; Langdon
exclaimed in disgust at Phil&#8217;s leniency. If
the pilot could have had his way he would
have wrung his neck then and there, which
punishment the foreigner doubtless deserved.</p>

<p>Phil did not reply immediately. A bold
plan had flashed through his mind, and he
was rapidly revolving it in his thoughts to
discover if it was feasible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell the Chinese to carry the prisoner,&#8221;
he said finally, his mind fully made up to attempt
the one scheme which seemed to give
the foreign commander a chance for his life.
If he left him in the foreign concession his
life would not be worth a copper cash when
the robbers from the city came back to complete
their ghoulish work.</p>

<p>Langdon trusted Phil&#8217;s judgment too
thoroughly to demur, so he quietly gave
Nam-Sing his orders, and then the three
Americans started, cautiously leading the
way down the alley and out upon the street
running toward the river.</p>

<p>Reaching the &#8220;Bund,&#8221; Nam-Sing pointed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
out the direction of the launch, which appeared
to be their last chance for safety.
Passing the waiting launch of Commander
Ignacio, Phil glanced uneasily at the sailors;
but they appeared to give them but passing
notice.</p>

<p>The midshipman saw Nam-Sing step aboard
a black launch some hundred yards down the
&#8220;Bund&#8221; from where their prisoner&#8217;s launch
was lying. Phil directed that the bound
foreigner be laid on the deck forward, then
he watched impatiently the crew of the
launch, under the guidance of the Chinese
leading man, go to work with the usual
Oriental industry. The lad saw at a glance
that the engine and boiler were beyond patching;
the machinery was a mass of twisted
steel, while the boiler tubes were bent and
wrenched from their sockets.</p>

<p>Quickly uncoupling the useless engine from
the propeller shaft, Nam-Sing directed the
removal of the boards covering from view the
small compact gas engine. With familiarity
he tested out the spark circuit and examined
the gear wheels, making sure all was right.
After a delay of not more than ten minutes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
although it seemed much more to the ever-increasing
anxiety of the Americans, the
Chinaman seized the crank lever, exerting his
power to start the engine. The machine
wheezed and sputtered. Again and again
came the wheezing cough and when Phil was
about to give up hope, it coughed volubly,
then the smooth chug of the rapidly rotating
engine struck joyfully on his ears.</p>

<p>Langdon took his place at the wheel, while
Phil motioned that all lines be cast off from
the shore, and presently the launch moved
slowly away from the dock out into the swift
current of the river.</p>

<p>&#8220;Head her for the starboard gangway of
the &#8216;Albaque,&#8217;&#8221; Phil ordered in a calm voice,
although his pulses were throbbing wildly.</p>

<p>Langdon fairly jumped with surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, man alive! What are you doing?&#8221;
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>In the gloom Phil almost smiled as he
realized how odd his plan, without explanation,
must seem to his companions.</p>

<p>He spoke quietly, his manner calm, but
decided.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall find a small boat in the water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
made fast to the lower swinging boom forward
of the gangway. When we get alongside,
I&#8217;ll go on board and give a message from
their captain. While I&#8217;m on board you and
Sydney move the launch ahead sufficiently to
be able to drop the prisoner over the bow
into the boat. Do it carefully and make
no noise. He is securely bound and will
lie there until the morning. By that time
we shall, I hope, be safely out of his
reach.&#8221;</p>

<p>Langdon and Sydney could hardly control
an expression of their enthusiasm at the conception
of such a daring plan. Its very
recklessness with Phil&#8217;s knack of mimicry
would carry it safely through.</p>

<p>A gruff hail in a foreign tongue came
startlingly from the black hull of the gunboat,
which the launch was slowly approaching.</p>

<p>Phil waited a second for breath and then
in the voice of the Chinese interpreter called
across the water:</p>

<p>&#8220;On the service of the viceroy.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the launch stopped at the gangway of
the war-ship Phil boldly ascended the ladder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
to the deck. There he found an officer awaiting
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Commander Ignacio has sent me for a
copy of the letter written by him yesterday
to the viceroy. This letter has been lost in
transit and he wishes to give his Excellency
the copy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil pronounced his words slowly, making
his accent even broader than that used by the
real Ta-Ling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you wait?&#8221; the officer asked politely.
&#8220;Commander Ignacio keeps his own papers.
I shall endeavor to find it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil bowed his willingness, and the foreign
officer beckoning the quartermaster to follow
with his lantern, the two disappeared within
the cabin.</p>

<p>The disguised midshipman saw the launch
crawl slowly ahead, and a moment afterward
his straining ear caught the indistinct sound
of a body being lowered into the whale-boat
tied at the boom of the gunboat. Then as
the launch drifted almost imperceptibly back
to its place at the ladder, the gleam of the
lantern told him that the ship&#8217;s officers were
returning.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>&#8220;Here is a package of letters marked for
the viceroy,&#8221; the officer said as he emerged
from the cabin; &#8220;but have you no written
message from my captain?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil feared he had gone too far. He
would like to hold the proofs of Commander
Ignacio&#8217;s perfidy, but not at the risk of
detection.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, your captain gave me no letter,&#8221; he
answered carelessly; &#8220;he supposed that Ta-Ling,
the viceroy&#8217;s secretary, was well enough
known; I am Ta-Ling, the viceroy&#8217;s secretary;
but if you do not wish to trust me I shall return
and get a letter from him. It will, however, displease
both your commander and the viceroy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The officer gave Phil a searching look, but
apparently seeing nothing suspicious in his
appearance, handed him the package.</p>

<p>Phil was about to descend the ladder, when
the officer, as if wishing to make amends for
doubting the honesty of the Chinaman,
stopped him by a motion of the hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a Chinaman on board who came
over in a sanpan, shortly after our captain
left the ship. He had escaped from a mob
ashore and asked our protection.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>Phil held himself well in hand, fearing by
undue interest he would jeopardize his cause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you care to see him?&#8221; the officer
continued.</p>

<p>The midshipman nodded indifferently.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must hurry,&#8221; he said; &#8220;my viceroy becomes
very impatient if he is kept waiting.&#8221;</p>

<p>An order was given to a sailor standing
near and Phil saw the man go rapidly forward.
The lad&#8217;s hopes ran high. Was it
Emmons?</p>

<p>A moment afterward Emmons was brought
aft by the sailor messenger. The lantern
was raised above the sailor&#8217;s head, shedding its
light on the startled face of the half-breed.
Phil regarded him with well-feigned loathing.</p>

<p>&#8220;This man is an enemy of the viceroy,&#8221;
Phil declared, in well simulated anger. &#8220;His
escape would be a very serious matter. I can
take him with me now if you will agree to
trust him in my hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>The officer did not exactly relish the turn
of affairs. If he had made a mistake in delivering
his captain&#8217;s letters and then the
fugitive into the wrong hands, he knew he
would suffer severely.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>&#8220;I dare not do that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;By my
government&#8217;s regulations asylum must be
given to all asking protection. To-morrow
after my captain returns he will, if he sees fit,
deliver him to the viceroy. I shall lock him
up for safety and you can be sure he will not
escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I have been searching for this man,&#8221;
Phil declared, his voice now really earnest.
He must get Emmons from his perilous
position. &#8220;It is all-important that he be
taken to the viceroy to-night. I can assure
you that if your captain were here he would
deliver him up to Ta-Ling.&#8221;</p>

<p>All suspicion had disappeared from the
officer&#8217;s mind upon hearing this earnest appeal.
After all, he was but a Chinaman, and he
knew his captain was very friendly with the
viceroy and his powerful secretary Ta-Ling.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I will take your
word that in delivering the man to you I
shall be acting as my captain would wish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He should be bound,&#8221; Phil said almost
gleefully. &#8220;Can you get me a rope?&#8221;</p>

<p>The officer, leaving Phil&#8217;s side, crossed the
deck to a chest; opening it, he searched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
through its contents. The midshipman,
greatly fearing an outbreak from Emmons,
stepped cautiously to his side and whispered
for him to make no outcry.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew you immediately,&#8221; Emmons
breathed.</p>

<p>At the sound of muttering voices, the officer
looked up quickly; the light of the lantern
on his face told Phil that his suspicions had
been aroused. Quicker than thought the
midshipman drew back his fist, then he shot
it forward, striking with force the startled
half-breed squarely under the chin. Emmons
lay where he fell, moaning audibly, while Phil
quietly explained his act to the officer.</p>

<p>&#8220;He had the temerity to revile me,&#8221; he
said; &#8220;but give me the rope. We should be
on our way back to the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>Emmons was quickly bound, hand and foot;
then Phil bowed ceremoniously and, lifting the
stunned man on his broad shoulders, walked
steadily down the ladder and into the launch,
where he deposited the body with a great show
of force for the benefit of those above. A few
seconds later the launch had left the war-ship
and was headed down the river as if she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
would again land in her berth at the
dock.</p>

<p>As soon as the gunboat had disappeared in
the darkness, Phil and Sydney cut the ropes
binding the prisoner and raised him to a seat
on the deck house. He was but stunned by
the blow and presently opened his eyes, gazing
about him in bewilderment.</p>

<p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221; Emmons asked, recognizing
in the thin light of a screened lantern
Phil&#8217;s anxious face bending over him. The lad
quickly explained the reason for his apparently
unfriendly act.</p>

<p>Emmons, with a genuine show of deep
gratitude, thanked the midshipman for his
unlooked-for deliverance; then he plied the
lads with eager questions, and Phil gave him
the unvarnished history of the night&#8217;s experiences;
of the triumph over Ta-Ling, and
then the ruse they had played upon Commander
Ignacio and the officer on board the
&#8220;Albaque.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have, I think, papers which will reveal
all that villain&#8217;s secrets,&#8221; he ended, patting
the papers in the pocket of his long Chinese
robe. &#8220;And the plan of the secret channel&mdash;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
have that safe here also,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We
owe a great deal to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Emmons, &#8220;but it has cost me
all that I have accumulated in ten years of
business. I got warning this afternoon from
the Tartar general that an order had been
signed by the viceroy for my execution. I
succeeded in hiding in an abandoned house in
the foreign concession while the soldiers of
Ta-Ling searched for me. After dark I tried
to find Nam-Sing and the launch which I was
holding in readiness to aid your escape, but
when I reached the docks I found all my
launches deserted, and their machinery
wrecked. Knowing that I could not remain
another day ashore without capture, I secured
a sanpan and sculled to the nearest gunboat,
believing I was then safe; but it seems
that I had put myself in the hands of an
enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The blood of every foreigner killed should
be laid to Ignacio&#8217;s account,&#8221; Phil declared
angrily; &#8220;but we have now the means of exposing
his treachery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell us about the mission,&#8221; he exclaimed
anxiously. &#8220;Is it yet unharmed?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>&#8220;It is still under the general&#8217;s protection,&#8221;
Emmons replied, &#8220;and he will not permit an
attack. I have expected every day to hear
that the soldiers had been removed. Ta-Ling&#8217;s
outlaws are encamped within a mile of
the soldiers, apparently waiting an order
from their leader.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How many are there of these rebels?&#8221;
Sydney asked in alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not seen them, but my men tell me
there are thousands,&#8221; Emmons answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;There must be some reason for the delay,&#8221;
Emmons declared. &#8220;Have you read the
viceroy&#8217;s letter to your captain?&#8221; he asked
quickly. &#8220;Maybe there we shall find the
cause of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>With trembling fingers Phil drew the letter
from his pocket and without hesitation broke
the formidable looking seal of the viceroy.
The writing was in English and the penmanship
seemed strangely familiar.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the same writing as that in the letter
I picked up in the bank!&#8221; he exclaimed in
surprise, then in the lantern&#8217;s dim light his
eager eyes traveled rapidly over the words before
him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>Sydney and Emmons waited impatiently
until Phil began to read excitedly:</p>

<p>&#8220;His Excellency, Chang-Li-Hun, is deeply
grieved at the lawless actions of the foreign
gunboats, which have banded together under
the leadership of the American commander to
defy the authority of the laws of China.
Commander Ignacio and two of his brother
commanders have accepted his Excellency&#8217;s
leniency and after voluntarily offering their
apology have anchored at Ku-Ling. To show
that China has kept faith, his Excellency has
caused a strong guard of his soldiers to encamp
on the hills near the American mission.</p>

<p>&#8220;If by ten o&#8217;clock to-morrow morning the
foreign gunboats will steam to Ku-Ling flying
white flags of truce, the viceroy will still give
them clemency. The viceroy has held the
hostages to show his displeasure at the foreigners
for entering To-Yan Lake, waters
forbidden them by the government of China.</p>

<p>&#8220;His Excellency will be powerless to protect
either the hostages or the mission if a
single hostile shot is fired. Enclosed is a
telegram for the American commander.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If this letter and the telegram had gone to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
Commander Hughes,&#8221; Phil exclaimed as he
folded the letter and returned it in his pocket,
&#8220;Ta-Ling and Ignacio would have won.
Without the strong personality of our captain
the allies would have weakened and accepted
the terms offered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now when Ta-Ling is liberated,&#8221; Sydney
cried alarmingly, &#8220;the soldiers will be removed
and the rebels allowed to attack the
mission.&#8221; Then he stopped suddenly, while
a lump rose in his throat. &#8220;Does Ta-Ling
suspect the secret of the channel is ours?&#8221;
he asked fearfully.</p>

<p>Emmons shook his head thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;The chart was procured by Hang-Ki from
the viceroy&#8217;s papers through bribing a lesser
official,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Ta-Ling may have
discovered its absence and suspected that I
would carry it to your captain. That would
explain his sudden desire to have me captured
and executed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-night is the turning-point in this
intrigue,&#8221; Phil exclaimed, while his heart
beat faster at the thought. &#8220;We must use
this channel to-night, and after we have run
the forts and anchored in safety above Ku-Ling,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
we must start at once to the rescue of
those in the mission. I hope Lieutenant
Wilson can withstand the assault until aid
arrives.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our poor sailors in the yamen,&#8221; he added
sorrowfully, &#8220;I fear are no better than dead
men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; Emmons declared in no
uncertain voice. &#8220;To-morrow Ta-Ling will
cause the high reed grass on the island to be
set on fire. It is dry and will burn like
tinder. Then the island will offer no protection,
the search-light on the fort will disclose
the presence of the gunboats and the secret
channel is well within the range of the fort
guns.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the midshipmen were absorbed in
their conversation with the half-breed, the
launch, under the skilful guidance of the
pilot, steamed rapidly down the swift current
of the river. The junks moored at the docks
flashed by unheeded. The high frowning
cliffs, on top of which were the gun emplacements,
appeared dimly from the darkness
ahead. Then the launch&#8217;s bow was turned
sharply to port, steering across the river, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
put as great a distance as possible between it
and the menacing batteries.</p>

<p>The midshipmen and Emmons had now
joined Langdon at his post at the wheel.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-night Hang-Ki has relieved many of
the lookouts in the forts,&#8221; Emmons whispered,
&#8220;and if we can keep close under the shadow
of the island we may pass undiscovered.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil was in a fever of anxiety. He glanced
fearfully at the frowning forts, looming oppressively
close in the darkness to starboard.
The island on the other side of which was the
secret channel slowly took shape, and as the
launch approached became ever more distinct.
Now he imagined he could see the tops of the
high reeds, tall enough to conceal the hull of
a gunboat, waving menacingly in the fitful
breeze, and in the stillness, broken only by
the muffled chug of the gas engine, he could
now hear the dry rustle telling him only too
plainly that this rank vegetation was ripe for
Ta-Ling&#8217;s torch.</p>

<p>The night was dark and cloudy, and the
deeper gloom of the island toward which
Langdon was steering would make it almost
impossible to locate the small launch.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>Even under the trying circumstances, expecting
momentarily to hear the loud discharge
of hostile cannon, Phil&#8217;s mind dwelt
anxiously on the possibilities before the coming
day. Fully realizing that the lives of
those in the mission depended upon the
ability of the allies to pass the forts before
morning, would they find the fleet prepared
to start immediately? Without mishaps two
hours must elapse before the launch could
reach Lien-Chow, and then scarcely five
hours of the night would remain.</p>

<p>With all lights save that at the compass
carefully screened, the launch sped quietly
onward. The forts had faded slowly into the
darkness as the island shore had been approached.
Langdon spun his wheel from
side to side seeking the deepest channel,
while a Chinaman with a long bamboo pole
measured the depth of the water continuously,
calling out in a sing-song whisper his soundings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on this side of the island,&#8221; Phil
ordered, hastily measuring with his eye the
distance by the chart. &#8220;Time&#8217;s precious.
We must run the risk.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>&#8220;Aye, aye,&#8221; the pilot answered quickly,
bringing the bow of the launch smartly about
to parallel the island shore. &#8220;They can&#8217;t hit
us anyway,&#8221; he added contemptuously.</p>

<p>Minute after minute dragged by. The
Americans were on the point of congratulating
themselves upon having passed the forts
in safety, when a flash of flame sprang from
the darkness of the hill forts and the screech
of a shell sounded menacingly in their ears.</p>

<p>With the anxiety of one who is being fired
upon without the opportunity to return the
fire, those on the launch stuck manfully at
their posts. Sydney&#8217;s blood raced rapidly
through his veins, and his hopes seemed on
the point of being cast to the very depths of
despair.</p>

<p>Flash followed flash on the fortifications
and the reverberations of the heavy artillery
shook the valley. It seemed to the midshipmen
that hundreds of guns must be hurling
tons of steel at their small inoffensive black
launch as it bravely steamed down the river.</p>

<p>With intense excitement and fearful dread
as to the outcome, all gazed fascinated upon
the myriads of flashes of flame from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
forts. The moans and screeches of the shells
were loud in their ears while the steel bolts
lashed the water to foam about them.</p>

<p>Suddenly a bright shaft of light bored
through the night and then swung spasmodically
over the water. Fearfully the midshipmen
watched the search-light ray in its attempt
to concentrate upon the rapidly moving
launch. When once they were held in its
beam, they would furnish as clear a target for
their enemy&#8217;s guns as if it were day.</p>

<p>As Phil watched, fascinated, the wavering
light, it stopped uncertainly short of the
launch but truly in line, then the light raised
suddenly and the lad was fairly blinded by
the bright flash as it clung tenaciously to the
discovered hull. The fort guns now renewed
their vociferous cannonade and the screech of
shells was sufficient to unnerve the stoutest
heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;One hit and we&#8217;ll be counted out,&#8221; Phil
exclaimed wildly, clutching Sydney in his
excitement, as he dodged involuntarily the
hot breath of the speeding projectiles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take that sounding pole!&#8221; Langdon
shouted hoarsely, as the terrified Chinaman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
dropped it on deck and dived for safety below
decks.</p>

<p>Sydney quickly grasped the pole as it clattered
from the man&#8217;s hand, and plunged it
over the side. It struck bottom, showing the
water had suddenly become dangerously shallow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep her off,&#8221; he cried loudly, above the
roar of the hissing shells.</p>

<p>Blinded by the bright glare of the search-light,
Langdon had nearly run the launch
ashore on the island, but by quick action, he
now threw the bow out into the river. A
low grating sound made Phil&#8217;s heart stop
beating, but the next second the launch
darted clear of the treacherous shoal. Then
to the joy of the anxious men the search-light
beam died suddenly away.</p>

<p>The fire from the forts immediately slackened,
and in a few seconds had ceased altogether.
An occasional boom and the screech
of a passing shell, however, showed the Americans
that the enemy was waiting impatiently
to begin its fusillade as soon as the now extinguished
search-light could again pick up
the helpless target.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>A startled cry from Emmons drew the
Americans&#8217; attention. Looking anxiously in
the direction indicated by the half-breed,
Phil saw the white and colored lights of a
steamer standing up the river, in the middle
of the main channel. Those in the forts
seemed also to have made the discovery.
The entire crest of the hill forts burst into
sudden flame and the distant screech of shell
told the lad that this time the launch was
not the target.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can it be?&#8221; he exclaimed in a fever
of excitement. &#8220;The allies know better than
to carry lights. It must be a stranger.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then as he gazed spellbound upon the
spectacle before him, the search-light of the
fort once more cut its narrow path of flame
through the inky blackness. It swept
spasmodically over the intruder and then to
the Americans&#8217; delighted eyes was revealed
the outline of a monitor, the light of the
search-light beam reflected brightly from her
glistening, pointed hull.</p>

<p>&#8220;The &#8216;Monterey&#8217;!&#8221; Phil cried, joyfully hugging
Sydney. &#8220;And Jack O&#8217;Neil is on board
her.&#8221; But a second later his joy was changed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
to apprehension. Would the monitor appreciate
the situation and be prepared to return
this fire? A fear took possession of his
thoughts that the sailors, not knowing of the
existence of hostilities, might have been
standing unprotected upon the deck and before
they could have sought the shelter of
armor many might have already been killed
by the shells of the enemy.</p>

<small>RE&Euml;NFORCEMENTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> eyes were now intent on the American
war-ship. The guns in the forts had become
silent, as if startled at the sudden appearance
of an enemy worthy of their metal. The
monitor, apparently unconscious of the danger
into which it had run, steamed proudly
onward. The search-light of the fort lighted
up every detail of the formidable vessel; the
heavy turret guns were lowered, pointing inoffensively
away from the inquisitive search-light.</p>

<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t dare fire again at her!&#8221; Sydney
exclaimed. &#8220;See, she has shown her
colors!&#8221;</p>

<p>As the midshipman spoke a large American
flag rose proudly aloft to the truck of the
&#8220;Monterey,&#8221; where it fluttered defiantly, as if
to say: &#8220;Now if you fire, knowing who I am,
you declare war on the country which I represent.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>Then the Chinese threw down the gauntlet;
a flash of flame darted from the dark fort,
licking the heels of a great shell, and a high
splash of foam sprang up in the glare of the
search-light not more than a half hundred
yards from the bow of the silent monitor.</p>

<p>Again, like huge fireflies on a summer
night, the hill forts flashed fire, while still
the monitor steamed boldly onward, closer
and closer to the hostile guns.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t she return it?&#8221; Sydney exclaimed
excitedly. &#8220;A few shots from her
guns will startle the soldiers in those forts.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the lads watched the one-sided contest,
two shafts of light darted from the monitor;
the search-light from the fort from its size
and greater illuminating power concealed the
commencement of the war-ship&#8217;s less powerful
lights, but upon the forts two round white
spots traveled slowly along, and where they
rested the midshipmen could see distinctly
the gun emplacements and the great gun
tubes protruding from the protecting rock
and earth.</p>

<p>In a terrible suspense those on the launch
held their breath, while the heavy turrets,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
plainly visible in the light from the forts,
swung around slowly; then the gun muzzles
were raised and pointed steadily at the two
white spots, the end of the search-light rays.
After a terrible suspense, two great tongues
of flame leaped far out over the river and a
dull boom shook the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine shots!&#8221; Phil exclaimed joyfully as
he saw the earth on two of the emplacements
rise in the air as if a magazine had exploded
underneath it.</p>

<p>Again the monitor spoke angrily with her
great twelve-inch guns, and again within the
illumination the eager watchers saw masses
of earth fly high in the air as the half ton
shells exploded on the very parapets of the
Chinese forts.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s turning!&#8221; Sydney exclaimed.</p>

<p>Sure enough, the &#8220;Monterey&#8221; was swinging
her bow away from the enemy. Not understanding
the meaning of this treatment, the
war-ship was circling to return down the
river, out of range of the formidable forts.</p>

<p>The search-light of the fort held steadily
upon the retreating war-ship, but those of the
&#8220;Monterey&#8221; had been extinguished. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
fort guns, for the time silenced by the straight
shooting of their enemy, now reopened with
renewed energy. But the monitor, as if unconscious
of the rain of shell about her,
turned in silence, her flag waving proudly at
the mast-head, and started down river.</p>

<p>&#8220;Head over for her!&#8221; Phil ordered.</p>

<p>With relief and satisfaction, the Americans
saw that now after the monitor had turned,
the Chinese gunners were shooting wildly.
All the shots were falling aimlessly short of
the retreating war-ship. But still the search-light
ray clung tenaciously, as if it feared the
monitor once out of the vision of its bright
eye would take wings and fly away.</p>

<p>Suddenly from the monitor&#8217;s after turret
belched forth a single flash. Those on the
launch watched in excited admiration to see
the burst of flame on the ramparts of the
fort, but instead, high above the guns, above
even the search-light mounted at the very top
of the hill, a jet of flame, a living ball of fire,
cleft the darkness; a second later and the
monitor had faded from sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shrapnel,&#8221; Phil exclaimed intensely, as
the sound of the explosion reached his ears;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
&#8220;that search-light is out of business for the
present.&#8221; Then he realized that the launch
and the &#8220;Monterey&#8221; were rapidly approaching
each other on converging courses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Light the side lights,&#8221; he cried to
Emmons, at his side, spellbound and silent.
&#8220;We can&#8217;t take the risk of having her shoot
at us. She might hit us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Emmons obeyed the order by giving a few
harsh commands to his reassured Chinese
boatmen and soon the red and green lights
were burning on the launch&#8217;s sides. The
forts were now silent, their target having
dissolved into the night, but Langdon had
taken her bearing and the launch&#8217;s bow was
held in the direction which he knew would
bring them close to the monitor.</p>

<p>After many long minutes of anxious search
a dark smudge appeared almost directly in
the path of the launch. Then suddenly a
flash sprang from the dark smudge, and a
shell shrieked across the bow of the approaching
boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop her!&#8221; Phil cried in alarm, while he
ran quickly forward. Standing at the bow
of the launch, he cleared his voice and raised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
his hands to his mouth, ready to answer the
hail from the war-ship.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boat ahoy!&#8221; came distinctly across the
water. &#8220;Stop where you are, or we&#8217;ll sink
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, aye, sir,&#8221; Phil hailed back. &#8220;We&#8217;re
friends&mdash;American naval officers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, don&#8217;t come any closer and
we&#8217;ll send a boat,&#8221; came the answer in clear,
decided tones.</p>

<p>Those on the launch noted the creak of
blocks as a boat shot down from its davits
into the water, and a few minutes afterward
they heard the regular dip of the oars and
their rhythmical thud in their sockets.
Then a long, slim whale-boat, propelled by
six stalwart sailors, shot out of the gloom
and came quietly alongside the motionless
launch.</p>

<p>An officer scrambled nimbly on board.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the meaning of this?&#8221; he exclaimed
in astonishment. For in the ray of the
solitary lantern held in the hands of a
Chinese boatman, he saw that he was in the
presence of Chinamen. He stopped precipitously,
sliding his hand cautiously to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
revolver holster while he eyed suspiciously
the men before him.</p>

<p>Phil was about to answer the officer&#8217;s
question, never realizing the cause of the
speaker&#8217;s abrupt silence, when his eye caught
sight of a familiar face peering in over the
launch&#8217;s rail. Forgetful of all else, the lad
hastened excitedly forward. Reaching down
he grasped the owner of the face in a strong
grip.</p>

<p>&#8220;O&#8217;Neil!&#8221; he exclaimed delightedly. &#8220;Well,
if this isn&#8217;t luck!&#8221;</p>

<p>While Sydney in his turn shook hands
warmly with their old friend the boatswain&#8217;s
mate, who had served with them through many
a difficult position during a South American
revolution, when they were together on the
battle-ship &#8220;Connecticut,&#8221; Phil explained the
situation to the mystified officer.</p>

<p>The lad for the moment had not fully appreciated
the dumbfounded astonishment of
the naval man, Lieutenant Washburn of the
&#8220;Monterey,&#8221; upon finding himself among
Chinamen, after he had heard the answer
from the &#8220;Monterey&#8217;s&#8221; hail that American
naval officers were on board the launch.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>&#8220;We&#8217;ve just escaped from prison,&#8221; Phil explained,
&#8220;and your ship arrived in time to
save us from those guns. Their shots were
beginning to come pretty near, I can tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Escaped from prison,&#8221; Lieutenant Washburn
exclaimed, still mystified. &#8220;Where
then is the &#8216;Ph&#339;nix&#8217;? She hasn&#8217;t been
sunk, I hope,&#8221; he added hastily in sudden
alarm.</p>

<p>Phil quickly set his mind at rest on that
point. &#8220;She&#8217;s at Lien-Chow, in the To-Yan
Lake, and we are on our way there now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Commander Hughes will be mighty relieved
to see the &#8216;Monterey&#8217;!&#8221; he exclaimed
joyfully. &#8220;With her the forts have no perils&mdash;she
can run by whenever she wishes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry for him,&#8221; Lieutenant Washburn
answered, his voice betraying a note of
bitterness, &#8220;for I am a great admirer of your
captain. He&#8217;s the kind of man we need in
command of our ships. There&#8217;s a rumor
afloat that he&#8217;s in disgrace and will be put
under arrest. I hope it&#8217;s not true, but the
rumor was persistent in the fleet when we
left. If it&#8217;s true I suppose our captain has
the order.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>Phil pretended to be greatly surprised and
unconsciously raised his hand to make sure
the telegram was safe in his pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;The &#8216;Monadnock&#8217; is on her way up the
river. She&#8217;s slower than we are, and as our
captain is senior he pressed ahead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nice surprise they gave us,&#8221; he added
laughingly, pointing to the now quiet forts.
&#8220;We thought they were only having target
practice and supposed of course they&#8217;d
stop to let us pass. But when they opened
on us, although our captain had sounded
to &#8216;general quarters&#8217; as a precaution, you
could have knocked us all down with a
feather.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am happy to say their target practice
upon us was not good,&#8221; Phil returned in high
humor; &#8220;but if you&#8217;ll excuse me, I&#8217;ll shed
these gay clothes. Mine are pretty seedy
after three days in a Chinese prison, but I&#8217;d
appear to better advantage when we go aboard
the &#8216;Monterey.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The war-ship, by signal-lights, informed her
lieutenant that she was about to anchor,
directing the launch to follow and then come
alongside.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>Before the rattle of chain announced that
the anchor was holding the steel fortress
stationary against the swift current, the midshipmen
recited to Lieutenant Washburn the
story of their adventures. O&#8217;Neil listened
eagerly, grunting with glee when they told of
the triumph over Ta-Ling and Commander
Ignacio.</p>

<p>After a short delay the launch was steered
alongside the anchored war-ship, and the
Americans, now in their own clothes, quickly
scrambled over the low side.</p>

<p>Commander Barnes, the monitor&#8217;s captain,
ranking junior to Commander Hughes, immediately
summoned the midshipmen and
Langdon to his cabin.</p>

<p>Phil as spokesman gave the surprised captain
a detailed account of the happenings
since the attempt to blow in the gates of the
American mission. Commander Barnes&#8217; eyes
opened wider and wider in astonishment as
the lad proceeded.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all very terrible,&#8221; he exclaimed after
Phil had finished. &#8220;The admiral knows
nothing of this. Why has not Hughes wired
the situation?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>&#8220;He has sent telegrams,&#8221; Phil declared,
&#8220;but the viceroy will not forward them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s strange,&#8221; the captain said in a
low voice. &#8220;The admiral led me to suppose
that I would be in command of the three
ships, and that Hughes would be relieved of
his command. Yet I have no orders to that
effect.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil trembled with joy at overhearing these
words, not intended for his ears. The &#8220;Monterey&#8221;
brought no orders. He held the only
order in his pocket, and the fatal telegram
would remain there until Commander Hughes
had won his fight and relieved the situation.</p>

<p>But time was pressing. The fleet must run
the batteries to-night. The arrival of the
monitors would make the passage of the secret
channel even more secure by hotly engaging
the forts if necessary. In order to make success
sure the midshipman knew that they
should proceed at once upon the remainder of
their journey.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br />


<small>ABOARD THE &#8220;PH&#338;NIX&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Commander Barnes</span> consulted his watch
and then called for his orderly. The ring of
the bell had scarcely sounded before a marine
stood obediently before him.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s eleven now,&#8221; the captain mused, then,
turning to the orderly:</p>

<p>&#8220;My compliments to the executive officer.
Tell him to secure and pipe down. We shall
remain here for the present.&#8221;</p>

<p>Forgetting in his anxiety the vast gulf in
rank between them, Phil raised his hand impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain!&#8221; he exclaimed, intensely in
earnest. &#8220;We must go to Commander
Hughes immediately. The mission must
be relieved to-night. It is probably now surrounded
by the outlaws. To-morrow the difficulties
will increase. The secret channel may
be impossible, besides there are four American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
sailors in prison in the yamen. By to-morrow
they will have been executed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Over Commander Barnes&#8217; face flitted for a
second the suspicion of a frown, while the
orderly waited with indecision in his manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the morning we shall have two monitors,&#8221;
the captain answered; &#8220;I think we can
rely on their guns to escort the fleet past the
forts without harm. However, you may go
on your launch and give your news to Commander
Hughes. I have orders forbidding
me to enter To-Yan Lake.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not see how the allied fleet can possibly
embark its sailors and be here before
daylight,&#8221; he added, after a few moments&#8217;
thought, &#8220;so I see no reason to keep my officers
and men up all night in waiting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Commander Hughes will be here inside
of three hours,&#8221; Phil urgently exclaimed.
&#8220;I am sure, sir, that he will not lose a moment.
He does not wish to risk fighting the
forts. If he can bring Ku-Ling under his
guns without a fight, he will win his point
and save the foreigners.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I may suggest, sir,&#8221; the midshipman
added in a respectful voice, &#8220;it would be best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
to keep all ready to get under way. It is but
ten miles to the allied fleet. We shall be
there in an hour and in two more the gunboats
will be here on their way to enter this
secret channel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Commander Barnes smiled indulgently at
the lad&#8217;s earnestness as he waved a dismissal
to the orderly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell the executive officer,&#8221; he said, &#8220;to be
ready to get under way in three hours and
notify the officer of the deck to keep a sharp
lookout for the &#8216;Monadnock.&#8217; Signal her
when sighted to anchor near us.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your captain has a convincing advocate
in you, Mr. Perry,&#8221; he continued, after the
orderly had departed with his message. &#8220;I
shall wait his coming and be ready to join him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil was elated with the success of his appeal,
and in a short time he had gathered his
party together ready to again embark in Emmons&#8217;
launch.</p>

<p>Before leaving the captain&#8217;s cabin the midshipmen
had asked that boatswain&#8217;s mate
O&#8217;Neil be allowed to go, to steer the launch,
which request Commander Barnes readily
granted.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>&#8220;The telegram is the only order relieving
our captain of his command,&#8221; Phil exclaimed
to Sydney while the launch sped toward the
distant lights of the allied fleet. &#8220;What
would happen if I gave him the cable?&#8221; he
asked quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He would have but to obey it,&#8221; Sydney
answered. &#8220;It&#8217;s a direct order from
the navy department. Commander Barnes
as senior officer of the American ships
would be bound to send a flag of truce and
offer his apologies for Commander Hughes&#8217;
actions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that would mean a victory for the
viceroy and Ta-Ling!&#8221; Phil exclaimed. &#8220;If
I lose my commission for it that telegram is
going to remain secret until the allied fleet
have exacted an humble apology and restitution
from those guilty of wishing to murder
innocent foreigners.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the light of a solitary lantern Phil
opened the envelope and glanced excitedly
over their enemy&#8217;s correspondence with the
viceroy. It was in English and written in a
clear and legible hand.</p>

<p>Paper after paper was read in silence by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
the two midshipmen, revealing the most bare-faced
treachery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you remember that day at the bank?&#8221;
Phil exclaimed suddenly after he had finished
reading a letter which he held open before
him, his face in the thin light betraying
intense wrath and indignation. &#8220;I have
wondered so often over that incident. I have
never until now been able to discover why
Ignacio was so angry at me for picking up
his letter from the ground. Do you remember
how he snatched it from my hand?
I thought he would strike me. Well, that innocent
sheet of paper was a letter from Ta-Ling.
If I could have held it another minute
much of our trouble would never have occurred.
This is Ignacio&#8217;s answer:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I will do all in my power to thwart the
aim of these Americans. I despise them as
much as you do. I have just drawn on the
company which I represent for the sum you
named, and it will be deposited in the bank
at Shanghai. When you have obtained the
viceroy&#8217;s signature, giving my company the
railroad rights from here to Peking, I shall
at once transfer this sum to your credit.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>&#8220;&#8216;Your letter was picked up from the bank
floor, where I had carelessly dropped it, by a
young American officer. I do not think he
had enough knowledge or time to divine its
meaning.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The two midshipmen looked sheepishly at
each other for a second and then both laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are innocents, aren&#8217;t we, Phil?&#8221; Sydney
laughed. &#8220;Now it&#8217;s all clear. Ignacio
attempted to throw the allies into a panic at
Lien-Chow. He worked himself into being
selected as the senior officer for the flag of
truce, and he concealed his eagerness so
cleverly that we thought he was afraid.
Then he played his game beautifully before
the viceroy. But by to-morrow morning
Ignacio&#8217;s dreams will be smashed. Ku-Ling
will awake to find the fleet at anchor with its
guns trained on the viceroy&#8217;s palace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this new mischief you&#8217;re hatching?&#8221;
inquired Langdon, approaching the
midshipmen, after having conned the launch
over the treacherous shoals at the entrance to
the lake. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be at the fleet in a short
time now,&#8221; he added, pointing to the lights
fast appearing ahead.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>Phil arose, throwing a swift glance at the
lights of the gunboats, growing ever brighter
as the launch sped swiftly onward. Then he
returned to his seat on the deck house and
told the pilot of the discovery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you never tell me of this meeting
with Ignacio in the bank?&#8221; Langdon
asked, in a hurt voice. &#8220;I might have put
two and two together and saved us a great
deal of trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! pipe down, Joe Langdon!&#8221; Phil
exclaimed, in good humor. &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t
have found it out any sooner than we did.
It&#8217;s all plain enough now after you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help worrying about our four
sailors,&#8221; Sydney said sadly, and immediately
the mirth died on Phil&#8217;s face. &#8220;After Ta-Ling
is released, he will be mad enough to have them
summarily executed.&#8221;</p>

<p>His companions made no reply. Each
felt that the chances for the four captive
Americans were small.</p>

<p>While the launch was approaching the line
of anchored ships, Phil left his two companions
and stood close beside O&#8217;Neil, while the
sailor steered for the lights which had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
pointed out to him as being on board the
&#8220;Ph&#339;nix.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads were delighted to have this fine
American sailor-man again with them. Phil
recounted again all the exciting adventures
through which they had just passed and
O&#8217;Neil in his turn told of the monotonous life
on board a monitor in Manila Bay.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s worse than going to sea in a submarine,
Mr. Perry,&#8221; the sailor exclaimed. &#8220;She&#8217;s so
low in the water and rolls so quickly that we
was awash all the way up the China coast.
We couldn&#8217;t use them big guns at sea; one
second they are pointing in the water and the
next they are looking at the moon; but here
in the river it&#8217;s different. We can cut our
name on those forts if they&#8217;ll give us a chance.</p>

<p>&#8220;That captain of yours, Mr. Perry, is a fire-eater.
There ain&#8217;t nothing he is afraid of.
I am glad,&#8221; he added, lowering his voice,
although there was no one but a Chinese
crew man within ear-shot, &#8220;to hear you tell
me that our skipper ain&#8217;t going to lead this
expedition. He&#8217;s all right when he gets good
and mad, like he did when the fort fired at
him to-night, but he ain&#8217;t got the initiative.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
Now, &#8216;Bucko&#8217; Hughes, that&#8217;s his name on
the foc&#8217;s&#8217;le, is different; he always likes to
hit first.&#8221; Then he continued in a moralizing
tone while he spun his wheel to steer the course
to bring the ship&#8217;s lights on a proper bearing:</p>

<p>&#8220;The longer I live, Mr. Perry, the more I
believe that&#8217;s the best tactics for a fighting man.
If you hit first and hit hard enough maybe
the other fellow&#8217;ll drop his fists and say he&#8217;s
had enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil slapped the sailor on the back in sign
of agreement with his views, while O&#8217;Neil
brought the &#8220;Ph&#339;nix&#8217;s&#8221; lights, now close
aboard, broad on his beam in order to round
to for a landing at the gangway, and in
answer to a hoarse challenge from the gunboat,
he sang out in his clear voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye! Aye!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re still midshipmen,&#8221; Phil corrected;
&#8220;you should have answered &#8216;No! No!&#8217;&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, sir,&#8221; the sailor returned
with a grin. &#8220;It ain&#8217;t who you are; it&#8217;s the
news you bring. If I&#8217;d said, &#8216;No! No!&#8217;
they might not have waked &#8216;Bucko,&#8217; and I
know he&#8217;d want to see you as soon as you
put foot on board.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few minutes later Phil led the way up
the gangway ladder and soon found himself
in the enthusiastic embrace of the officer of
the deck. Although it was after twelve
o&#8217;clock many of the officers were awake and a
glance about the ship told the midshipman
that careful preparations were being made to
protect the vital parts of the gunboat from
the shells of the enemy.</p>

<p>They were told that Commander Hughes
was in the cabin and as yet in ignorance of
the return of the hostages.</p>

<p>&#8220;I sent down word just now by the
orderly,&#8221; the officer of the deck said with a
smile, &#8220;that some commissioned officers were
coming alongside in a launch, so I suppose
he&#8217;s awake, for it&#8217;s not often that we receive
callers this time of night.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three Americans and Emmons went
hastily to the captain&#8217;s cabin, where they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
found the orderly awaiting them, while Commander
Hughes was seated at his desk. Phil
was shocked at the change in his captain&#8217;s
face. His buoyant expression had been displaced
by a haggard look and as he turned
his eyes toward the door, the lad noticed, with
a twinge of pity, that their expression was
one of worry, while the dark circles below
them told only too plainly the story of sleepless
nights.</p>

<p>It was not until Phil had advanced almost
to his side that Commander Hughes realized
who his visitors were. Then the mask
dropped from his face and he sprang eagerly
to his feet with a glad cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was just thinking,&#8221; he exclaimed joyfully
as he embraced one after another of the
men returning to him as if from the grave,
&#8220;that for a glimpse of you safe on board here
again I&#8217;d give ten years of my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>After the first joyful shock of meeting was
over Commander Hughes made the midshipmen
and their companions be seated, and
each in turn told the thrilling details of his
experiences since leaving Lien-Chow with
the flag of truce. The story of Commander<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
Ignacio&#8217;s duplicity, much to the lads&#8217; surprise,
brought forth but little comment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have suspected him,&#8221; their captain
answered, almost sadly, &#8220;since his return
without you.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the part in their ventures taken by
Emmons was told him, Commander Hughes
arose from his chair and, much to the embarrassment
of the half-breed, took his hand in
both of his, thanking him eloquently for his
self-sacrificing acts. Then Phil&#8217;s heart leaped
with delight as his captain cast from him all
signs of sentiment; the old fire had returned
to his eyes.</p>

<p>The midshipmen were so intent upon their
own experiences that the mention of the arrival
of the monitors came only at the end of
their narrative.</p>

<p>Commander Hughes could hardly believe
his ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;The monitors are actually here!&#8221; he exclaimed,
doubting the welcome news. It was
too good to be true.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_256.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><i>&#8220;THE MONITORS ARE ACTUALLY<br />
HERE!&#8221;</i></p>

<p>&#8220;The &#8216;Monterey&#8217; is at anchor at the
entrance of the lake,&#8221; Phil assured him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
&#8220;The &#8216;Monadnock&#8217; should have arrived by
now. Commander Barnes has kept up steam
awaiting your arrival. I told him you would
go up the river to-night,&#8221; he added hastily.</p>

<p>Commander Hughes&#8217; joy showed plainly in
his strong face.</p>

<p>&#8220;How glad I should be that I have not
yielded to the persistent counsels of the other
captains!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;No one knows what
these last few days of suspense and uncertainty
have been. When Ignacio left us it
required the combined effort of Buresford and
myself to prevent the rest from following like
a flock of sheep. I had wrung a reluctant
promise from those remaining to attempt to
run the batteries to-morrow night unless the
viceroy agreed to our demands. My letter to
him sent by one of the renegades has not been
answered.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil gasped. The viceroy&#8217;s answer was
in the pocket of his blouse, but he must not
deliver it. To do so would betray the fact of
a telegram.</p>

<p>&#8220;But now,&#8221; the captain continued, &#8220;we cannot
wait for his answer. The lives of those
in the mission depend upon immediate action
on our part. I feel sure that the news of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
arrival of the monitors and this chart of a
safe channel will bolster up our allies&#8217; waning
courage.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear for the sailors in the yamen,&#8221; he
added, a note of grave anxiety in his voice;
&#8220;but if a hair of their heads is injured I shall
not rest until those guilty of the outrage are
punished. The viceroy himself shall not
escape the penalty of this crime.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE START FOR KU-LING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> midshipmen, after leaving the captain&#8217;s
cabin, hastened to their rooms to bathe and
don fresh clothes. Phil eyed his bunk longingly;
he had not had a comfortable sleep for
many nights, but he withstood the temptation
and soon found the duty of helping to
prepare the ship for battle far more interesting.</p>

<p>Commander Hughes had signaled at once
for the gunboat captains, and each had left
the &#8220;Ph&#339;nix,&#8221; enthusiastic at the lucky turn
affairs had taken, and cordially willing to
co&ouml;perate.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am in doubt,&#8221; Commander Hughes confided
to Phil on the quarter-deck, where the
lad had been directing the work of the men
of his division, &#8220;what to do with our non-combatants.
Each gunboat is carrying a
dozen or more of their own nationality,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
former residents of the foreign concession at
Ku-Ling. These gunboats will offer no protection
to the women and children if we are
discovered and fired upon by the forts. One
large shell might even, if it hit in a vital spot,
sink this vessel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not put all on board the monitors?&#8221;
Phil suggested; &#8220;they would be perfectly safe
there behind armor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A good idea,&#8221; the captain replied gladly.
&#8220;I shall signal at once to have the refugees
ready to disembark.</p>

<p>&#8220;How many can Emmons&#8217; launch carry?&#8221;
he questioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good-sized boat, sir,&#8221; Phil replied.
&#8220;I should say certainly fifty persons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s very well,&#8221; the former said. Then
Phil, recognizing a change of tone in his
superior&#8217;s voice, drew himself to attention as
the captain added slowly:</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall be ready to get under way at
one o&#8217;clock at the latest. You will follow in
the launch and when the &#8216;Ph&#339;nix,&#8217; which of
course will lead the column, reaches the monitors,
you will begin at once to transfer all
refugees from the gunboats, dividing them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
equally between the two monitors. I shall
write out immediately orders for the commanding
officers of the &#8216;Monterey&#8217; and &#8216;Monadnock,&#8217;
which I shall hand you for delivery
before you shove off. They will be unable to
follow us through the secret channel, as their
draft is too great, so I have directed that they
remain beyond the range of fire of the forts,
unless by chance we are menaced by the
enemy&#8217;s guns.</p>

<p>&#8220;I sincerely hope,&#8221; he continued in a less
official voice, &#8220;that nothing happens to either
of the monitors with such precious freight.
Do you know, Mr. Perry,&#8221; he added feelingly,
&#8220;out in these countries where lives are so
cheap, we Americans would sacrifice a whole
shipload of men for the single life of a mother
or a child.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil inclined his head in mute token of
agreement to his captain&#8217;s humane sentiment.
Then suddenly a thought seemed to strike
the latter, and he drew the lad farther away
from the sailors engaged in making a protecting
screen of hammocks about the after-gun
positions, for greater safety against the
possibility of infantry fire from the island,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
close to which the channel was shown to
lead.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your theory, Mr. Perry,&#8221; he asked
earnestly, &#8220;of the actions of Commander Ignacio?
Is it merely a hostile dislike for me
and our countrymen, or does it come from a
deeper and more subtle reason?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil hesitated; could he give his honest
views, or more correctly speaking, his knowledge
of the reasons for Ignacio&#8217;s actions, without
endangering the asking of a question
from his captain, to answer which he might
have to descend to subterfuge and even deceit?
The fatal telegram lay snugly in his
pocket; he could almost imagine that Commander
Hughes&#8217; piercing eyes could read,
through the cloth of his blouse, the words
which seemed engraved in bold letters on the
lad&#8217;s brain. Phil had purposely cautioned
his companions to say nothing of the captured
letters which had passed between Ignacio
and the viceroy&#8217;s secretary, for fear that the
many allusions to the hope of accomplishing
the disgrace of the American leader might
awaken suspicion. These letters, the boy had
decided, could not be of benefit now to Commander<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
Hughes, but would be of vital importance
in justifying the suppression of the
cablegram taken from the person of Ta-Ling.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think, sir,&#8221; Phil answered after several
moments of silence, &#8220;that Commander Ignacio&#8217;s
motive lies much deeper than personal
enmity. There must surely be some important
objective toward which he has been striving.
Possibly,&#8221; he hinted vaguely in an endeavor
to have his captain broach the real reason, of
which the lad knew only too well, &#8220;he believes
that he can secure better commercial
benefits for his own countrymen and to the hurt
of American interests. They say that the viceroy
has been openly antagonistic for months
to all American investments in his provinces.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How stupid of me!&#8221; Commander Hughes
exclaimed. &#8220;The railroad to Peking and
through the interior provinces! I have been
so much engrossed with my own troubles that
I have not given the motive of this hostile
action the attention which it deserves. I
heard in Shanghai before we sailed that the
American corporation having the railroad
concession rights was having great trouble
in getting permission to break ground, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
great mass of material is lying idle in steamers
awaiting permission of the viceroy to land. Of
course, that must be at the bottom of all this!</p>

<p>&#8220;It is this commercial rivalry which will
forever keep the Chinese from looking upon
foreigners as desirable residents of their
country,&#8221; he continued thoughtfully. &#8220;We
are ever at each other&#8217;s throats in our commercial
dealings. There are grave consequences
to be feared in the opening of this
vast and rich territory, and if we are not
strictly honest in our dealings with each other,
the consequences may well warrant the building
of a great navy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Commander Hughes, as he finished speaking,
gazed out over the water to the anchored
ships of the allied fleet and then, nodding a
dismissal to the midshipmen, he walked toward
the companion ladder leading to his
cabin.</p>

<p>&#8220;The signal is two white lights when
ready,&#8221; he said to the officer of the deck.
&#8220;Notify me when all the ships have shown
the signal, and keep the launch ready for
Mr. Perry.&#8221; Then to Phil, as he descended the
companionway, &#8220;Langdon must of course stay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
with us. We shall need him to help us over
the shoals at the entrance to the lake.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil saluted and then glanced at the clock
on the cabin bulkhead. He saw its hands
pointed to twenty minutes of one. In but a
few hours all would be decided. Either
Commander Hughes would win and his act
of suppressing the cablegram be condoned, or
else the gunboats would be utterly defeated,
maybe destroyed by the fire of the forts and
his hated enemy Ignacio raised to power as
the leader of the dissenters. The possibilities
were so terrifying that he looked about him
for some object upon which to concentrate his
mind. He wished to keep himself from
brooding on the future of the night&#8217;s venture.
Gazing out into the darkness, he could see
black smoke and sparks belching from the
smoke-stacks of the &#8220;Ph&#339;nix&#8217;s&#8221; consorts.
The shrill whistles of the boatswain&#8217;s mates
and the creaking of tackles came distinctly
across the still water, showing their hurried
preparations to be ready.</p>

<p>He saw that two white lights burned at the
yard-arm of his own ship; she then was ready
to lead the fleet on its perilous undertaking;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
to run by, well inside of the range of the forts&#8217;
guns, with but a screen of high grass to protect
the unarmored ships from the heavy
shells of their enemy. While the lad watched
silently, his pulses beating fast, the signal of
readiness flashed out from gunboat after gunboat,
until the entire fleet had mutely informed
the &#8220;Ph&#339;nix&#8221; that it was ready and
eager to follow the lead of its intrepid commander.</p>

<p>A moment later he heard a step at his side,
and the captain&#8217;s voice saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Here are the orders for the monitors.
You understand what you are to do. I shall
give you further orders later.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil took the two envelopes and put them
carefully in his pocket; then seeing his captain&#8217;s
hand still extended, he grasped it
warmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We little realize how much depends upon
our success to-night,&#8221; Commander Hughes
said in an earnest voice. Then casting from
him the air of depression, he added lightly,
&#8220;Our star is still in the ascendent. We shall
not consider failure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil gazed almost worshipfully at his captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
as the latter left him, going forward
toward the gunboat&#8217;s bridge to make the signal
which would launch the fleet upon its
perilous mission; then he was conscious that
Sydney stood by him and the officer of the
deck appeared anxious to have the big launch
shove off. Together the lads descended the
ladder, followed by Emmons as an interpreter
for the Chinese crew men, for Langdon had
been detailed to remain to pilot the fleet.</p>

<p>Quietly the fleet got under way, forming in
column of vessels with the American gunboat
leading. Then as if by signal, commencing
with the leader, each of the gunboats dissolved
into the night. To the lads it appeared
as if a cloak had been thrown over each vessel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Their lights are all screened!&#8221; Sydney exclaimed.
&#8220;Look! you can barely see the vessel
following the &#8216;Ph&#339;nix.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil allowed his eyes to travel over the
scene where a moment before many lights
pierced the darkness; now all that was visible
was the shadowy form of the American vessel
scarce a hundred yards away and a dark
smudge of the next following; all others had
vanished from view.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>In the long, tedious hour necessary to arrive
at the anchored monitors, the midshipmen
stood by O&#8217;Neil and Emmons at the launch&#8217;s
wheel. Their pulses beat high in semi-dread
at what the night would bring forth. They
had seen enough of the marksmanship of the
forts to know that their gunners were not to
be despised. The island, behind which the
gunboats were to find refuge in passing the
forts, was low, but being covered with a dense
growth of giant reeds, would conceal all but
the lofty spars of the vessels, which for
greater security had been lowered to the decks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there any doubt of the existence of this
channel?&#8221; Sydney questioned Emmons, a
sudden fear of treachery coming into his
mind, for if it were not there the gunboats
endeavoring to find its entrance would ground
upon the shifting shoals of the river and
when day dawned be under fire at close
range of the enemy&#8217;s guns.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have navigated my launches on the
river for six years,&#8221; Emmons replied, &#8220;and
never until the Tartar general gave me this
chart did I suspect that the channel existed.
There is a legend among the Chinese sailors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
that it was used by war junks a half century
ago in escaping from British men-of-war.&#8221;</p>

<p>After arriving at the anchorage of the
monitors, for the &#8220;Monadnock&#8221; now lay
near her consort, Phil directed the launch
be steered alongside the farthest gunboat.
Refugees, men, women and children, carrying
in their hands but the necessary clothes
for one night, quickly embarked and were
carried expeditiously to the monitors, where
Phil gave Commander Hughes&#8217; verbal instructions
and the written orders.</p>

<p>This duty completed, the launch once more
drew up alongside of the &#8220;Ph&#339;nix&#8217;s&#8221; gangway
ladder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Perry!&#8221; called a voice from the
bridge, which Phil recognized as that of his
captain. &#8220;Remain in the launch and start
ahead of us. If you find less water than our
draft, signal us at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil acknowledged the order and gave the
word to proceed. He had taken the precaution
to make a rough sketch of the chart;
now laying the sheet of paper on the deck
house under the ray of a bull&#8217;s-eye lantern he
judged the course to steer. O&#8217;Neil swung the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
launch&#8217;s bow in the compass direction, while
the Chinese leadsman stood ready to test the
depth of water with his bamboo pole.</p>

<p>Silently they sped onward; the low island
across the river slowly took shape and the lad
directed the boatswain&#8217;s mate to steer for the
end of the black line barely discernible above
the water.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are now within the arc of fire of the
forts,&#8221; Phil whispered to Sydney; &#8220;from here
to the island the gunboats will be unprotected
if discovered by the sentries at the guns.
However, it&#8217;s long range, and fortunately the
night is dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>Silently and regularly the leadsman thrust
downward his pole until twelve feet, three
feet greater than the maximum draft of the
gunboats, was buried beneath the surface.</p>

<p>All on board the launch were silently anxious.
The deep channel of the river had been
left behind and, under the train of the fort
guns, they were traveling over water that on
the charts issued by the home government
showed barely enough water to float a row-boat,
and yet the leadsman untiringly
plunged his bamboo to a distance of twelve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
feet without touching the sandy bottom.
Hope rose in Phil&#8217;s heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Emmons&#8217; chart is true!&#8221; Sydney exclaimed
in a low, joyful voice. &#8220;See, we&#8217;re
nearly abreast of the point. In a few minutes
more the island will be between us and the
guns.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s eyes traveled excitedly over the
scene; the forts, some thousands of yards
away, were enshrouded in darkness; the
island appeared ever more distinct, the deep
shadow of its high vegetation rising ghastly
from the water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Round the point close,&#8221; Phil directed
O&#8217;Neil, &#8220;and keep in to the shore-line.&#8221;</p>

<p>Boldly the launch neared the dark land,
now so near at hand that it seemed possible
in the darkness to reach out and touch the
long, overhanging reeds. The dry rustle of
the wind among the rank growth seemed in
the silence almost as loud as the footsteps of
an army marching.</p>

<p>So far all seemed to be progressing happily
for the allies. The channel was an established
fact and the midshipmen saw with relief that
once behind the island the gunboats could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
not be seen by the soldiers in the forts. The
island was narrow, but so long that when the
vessels emerged from its protection above the
city of Ku-Ling, they would be in the dead
angle of the heavy batteries and well beyond
the range of the lighter guns.</p>

<p>The launch chugged steadily onward, the
intention being to discover if possible any
shoaling of the water in the channel, but the
leadsman&#8217;s bamboo pole betrayed no change.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that ahead, sir?&#8221; O&#8217;Neil exclaimed
suddenly; &#8220;It&#8217;s a launch, I&#8217;m
sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads strained their eyes in the direction
indicated, but could see nothing; then a light
shot into the air, followed by a shower of
sparks and a bright flame, and again all was
darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does it mean?&#8221; Phil gasped in sudden
alarm. &#8220;It&#8217;s a launch, that&#8217;s sure. She&#8217;s
carrying no lights, and the flame from her
smoke-stack shows she has seen us and is making
haste to escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s going faster than we are, too,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil exclaimed, his keen eyes detecting
what the midshipmen had failed to see.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>&#8220;Do you smell smoke?&#8221; Sydney questioned
anxiously.</p>

<p>A moment later there was no longer doubt
of the presence of smoke; a light breeze from
the direction of the island carried the pungent
odor of burning brush down the wind to the
nostrils of the surprised Americans.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a fire on the island!&#8221; O&#8217;Neil suddenly
exclaimed.</p>

<small>THE SECRET CHANNEL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the Americans had departed, leaving
Ta-Ling tightly bound and gagged on the cell
floor, the Chinaman remained quietly bemoaning
his cruel destiny. He knew from
the silence throughout the yamen that it
would be futile for him to waste his strength
in useless struggling at the bonds that bound
him. His Oriental mind counseled self-destruction.
There was no alternative to wipe
out the dishonor of being defeated and humiliated
by his despised enemies. The loss of his
sacred cue was a bitter misfortune. How
could he appear before his brother mandarins
with this necessary appendage missing? The
more he revolved the situation over in his
mind, the calmer he became. His Western
teaching, with its more worldly and less
devious ways of thought, came to his aid,
driving away all ideas of self-destruction, and
he resolved that he would fight according to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
the methods taught by his new learning so
long as life remained him.</p>

<p>It seemed to the helpless man that many
hours must have passed while he remained
motionless on the damp earth. He had during
this time thought over and over again of
all that had been said by the Americans.
While he lay to all appearances insensible, he
had heard the wording of the cipher message
to the American commander. He had been
upon the point of sending the cablegrams to
the American ship, but now they were in the
hands of the midshipmen and he had heard
them say that they would not give them to
their captain. So much of the plan of his ally,
Commander Ignacio, was a failure.</p>

<p>The missing chart which he felt sure had
been taken by Emmons caused him the greatest
anxiety. He had intended to block this
channel with sunken stone-laden junks, but
with the usual roundabout methods of the
Chinese he had found the mandarin in charge
of such work could not load the junks for
some days, so he had passed it by, believing
that the presence of such a channel would remain
a secret. Hang-Ki, the Tartar general,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
could be the only one of those in the secrets
of the yamen who would dare thwart him.
Ta-Ling&#8217;s veins swelled with suppressed anger
as he blamed his ill-luck for not having succeeded
in his attempt on the general&#8217;s life.
This man he felt sure was also in the daring
plot which had liberated the Americans and
placed him, second only in power to the
viceroy, in chains, helpless, while his carefully-laid
scheme of forever ridding China of the
foreign leeches was falling like a house of
cards about his head.</p>

<p>While his mind grappled with the intricate
intrigues, there came a dull boom of heavy
cannon, shaking violently the yamen. Again
and again the earth was shaken and the deep
tones of discharges of great guns reverberated
through the vast building.</p>

<p>What did it mean? Had the Americans
then succeeded in escaping and were the fort
guns firing upon them? How could they escape
by water when every launch had been
wrecked by his trusted soldiers?</p>

<p>The yamen now was no longer silent. Ta-Ling
could hear shrill cries and the hurried
march of feet. Men were running wildly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
here and there, an unknown fear in their
hearts. The Chinaman&#8217;s hopes rose; the
viceroy would send for him to know the
cause of the firing and he must before long
be discovered. He tugged desperately but
fruitlessly at his bonds, but Langdon had
done his work well.</p>

<p>Exhausted and breathless, he at length
resigned himself to fate. Then he heard his
own name cried by the viceroy&#8217;s crier, resounding
loudly throughout the yamen.
After what seemed an eternity, the door of
his cell was thrown open and several guards
entered the dark prison.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here they are,&#8221; he heard a soldier exclaim,
and then he felt himself grasped
roughly and carried out into the courtyard.</p>

<p>The next moment a light was thrust in his
face and then the guards recoiled in mortal
fear as they beheld the features of the Chinese
tyrant.</p>

<p>&#8220;We beg a million pardons, Excellency,&#8221;
the leader cried, cringing before the terrible
eye of the viceroy&#8217;s secretary, while his companions
prostrated themselves before him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>Ta-Ling made a sign to remove his gag, his
joy at deliverance fighting with his outraged
dignity at being so roughly handled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take off these irons, you dogs,&#8221; he hissed
when he could speak; &#8220;the keys are on the
floor of the cell.&#8221;</p>

<p>The keys were quickly brought from where
Ta-Ling had seen them thrown by the midshipmen,
and soon he was free.</p>

<p>&#8220;Meet me at the yamen gate,&#8221; he ordered
huskily, kicking a kneeling figure savagely
to punctuate his words; and then he hastened
to his quarters to replace the clothes of which
his former captives had deprived him.</p>

<p>Upon the threshold of his room he encountered
the frail figure of the aged mandarin,
his features stamped with fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;You traitor,&#8221; he cried in a weak trembling
voice, as he caught sight of the disheveled
Ta-Ling; &#8220;so this is the end of your
vain boasting. The foreign dogs are coming
to destroy me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The secretary used all of his powers of
persuasion to reassure his master. He told
the viceroy hurriedly of the escape of the
Americans and the loss of the chart, but protested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
that there was no immediate danger
from the guns of the fleet.</p>

<p>Leading the trembling old man back to his
own room, he called loudly for the treasurer,
appreciating that in order to make true his
words to his master not a second must be
wasted.</p>

<p>Receiving no answer to his call, he retraced
his steps to his room, and there he was not
surprised to find the bound body of his friend
in the dark corner where Phil had thrown him.</p>

<p>After setting the man free, he gave him
hasty instructions and sent him to keep the
viceroy company, while he feverishly threw
on the garments of a mandarin before joining
his awaiting soldiers. Hastily writing an
order he took it to the viceroy for signature,
then calling a waiting messenger he directed
it be taken at once to the Tartar general at
the forts.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Ta-Ling, preceded by his
guards, pressed through the frightened throngs
of Chinese in the narrow street outside of the
yamen. The gun fire had now ceased and the
terrified natives were slowly slinking back to
their hovels.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>Passing unhindered through the city gate,
the secretary led the way directly to the jetty.
Here he was to have met his ally, Commander
Ignacio, earlier in the evening, but much to
his surprise and satisfaction, as he reached
the landing, he saw a steam launch waiting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you take me to the &#8216;Albaque&#8217;?&#8221; he
questioned the coxswain eagerly.</p>

<p>The sailor glanced up in surprise. Where
was his captain? He had seen him, as he
supposed, with this Chinaman.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am waiting for the captain,&#8221; he replied,
a shade of suspicion in his voice. &#8220;Wasn&#8217;t
he with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Ta-Ling&#8217;s turn to be surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;With me!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I was to have
met him hours ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>The coxswain shook his head, mystified.
Had he not seen his captain go away with this
man? Then he suddenly thought of the
crowd of Chinese who had boarded a launch
below him and had then gone alongside of his
ship. His captain surely could not have been
among those men. He gave it up. It was
too deep for his understanding, for that launch
had then gone down the river shortly before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
the fight between the forts and a strange war-ship.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right; get in,&#8221; he said finally.</p>

<p>In several minutes Ta-Ling was greeted
warmly by the officer of the deck of the
&#8220;Albaque.&#8221; The latter was glad to see the
Chinaman again. The quartermaster of the
gunboat had persisted that the launch of the
Chinaman had not landed, but had gone
down the river, and the young officer had
commenced to fear that he had been duped
into giving up both the captain&#8217;s correspondence
and the Chinese refugee.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I see your captain?&#8221; Ta-Ling asked
anxiously. &#8220;It&#8217;s of the utmost importance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My captain has not returned!&#8221; the officer
exclaimed, alarm in his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is he? quick, man! Everything
depends upon my finding him at once,&#8221; Ta-Ling
cried in vexation.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was with you; the launch was waiting
for him,&#8221; the officer returned, catching his
breath, his heart in his throat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen him since this morning,&#8221;
the Chinaman declared impatiently. &#8220;Does
no one know of his whereabouts?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>The officer was rooted to the spot from
fright. His throat was parched with fear
and his tongue unruly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were here to-night asking for the
papers of the captain,&#8221; he managed to gasp,
his worst fears realized.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re dreaming, man,&#8221; Ta-Ling retorted
almost angrily. &#8220;Come, explain! What do
you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>The officer related to the anxious Chinaman
how some one whom he could have taken
oath was he had come on board from a launch
and he had given him the copies of his
captain&#8217;s letters to the viceroy, and also a
Chinese refugee who had escaped on board
from the shore.</p>

<p>Ta-Ling groaned in anguish as the full
significance of this news dawned upon him.
The Americans evidently had Emmons&mdash;and
his chart. But had they escaped? That was
surely the cause of the firing.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was the firing?&#8221; Ta-Ling asked
hurriedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;An American monitor and the forts,&#8221; the
officer replied in a shaky voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have I done?&#8221; he added questioningly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
much terrified over the results of his
indiscretion.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve given your captain&#8217;s letters to his
enemy, for one thing,&#8221; the Chinaman answered
in his cruel voice, &#8220;and besides you
have liberated a man&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>A shrill cry from the steam launch, which
had, while waiting for the Chinaman, hauled
out to the lower boom to lie more securely in
the tideway, cut short Ta-Ling&#8217;s words and
drew the two men to the rail.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a man tied hand and foot in this
boat,&#8221; called out the coxswain in alarm.
&#8220;It&#8217;s the captain!&#8221; he exclaimed with many
imprecations upon those who had perpetrated
the deed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cut him loose, quick!&#8221; the officer cried
excitedly.</p>

<p>Eager hands quickly cut the tight cords,
and Commander Ignacio soon stood on his
quarter-deck.</p>

<p>&#8220;An hour ago I would have throttled you
if you&#8217;d stood here before me,&#8221; were his first
words, spoken hoarsely and with difficulty to
the Chinaman, &#8220;but I see it all now. We&#8217;ve
been unmercifully duped.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_284.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><i>&#8220;THERE IS STILL A CHANCE&#8221;</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>With many bitter recriminations the whole
plot and its disastrous success was discussed.
Commander Ignacio could barely control his
rage against the young officer who had innocently
betrayed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, we must act at once!&#8221; Ta-Ling
finally exclaimed. &#8220;There is still a chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>The foreign captain&#8217;s face brightened as
he questioned eagerly the excited secretary.</p>

<p>&#8220;The channel will be useless to the fleet if
we can burn off the reed grass,&#8221; Ta-Ling
explained quickly. &#8220;The land itself is low
and will not hide the gunboats from the forts.
But we must be quick. That fire-eating
American will start immediately he receives
the information of this channel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come to my cabin,&#8221; Ignacio ordered in
a low voice, glancing suspiciously at his
abashed lieutenant.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I understand you,&#8221; he continued as the
door closed behind them, &#8220;you ask me to aid
you in burning the vegetation on this island.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly!&#8221; Ta-Ling cried impatiently.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it to your interest that this American
does not succeed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Softly,&#8221; cautioned the foreign captain;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
&#8220;we don&#8217;t want our talk to be common property,&#8221;
indicating by a motion of his hand
the hatchway leading to the sleeping quarters
of his officers; &#8220;some one may be awake down
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ignacio pondered for a few seconds. To go
in his own launch and set fire to this island
would betray his part in the intrigue with
the viceroy. His sailors could not be depended
upon to keep such a secret.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see no alternative but to decline,&#8221; he
continued decidedly. &#8220;You must do this act
yourself; my men could not be trusted with
such a secret.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will furnish the men,&#8221; Ta-Ling cried,
beside himself with impatience. &#8220;You must
furnish me a launch with some one to run it;
but hurry, man,&#8221; he urged excitedly. &#8220;The
grass must be burned off before the fleet
arrives at the island, or else we are defeated.&#8221;</p>

<p>Commander Ignacio immediately awoke to
action. The thought of the lieutenant who
had innocently betrayed him came happily to
his mind; he could run the engine and the
sailors could remain on board ship. The
secret would be safe with this officer. No<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
one could connect him with the act of burning
the island.</p>

<p>The lieutenant was called and was eager to
regain his captain&#8217;s favor. Ten minutes later
the launch from the &#8220;Albaque,&#8221; manned by
the Chinese soldiers, with Commander Ignacio
himself at the helm, had quietly left the
gunboat.</p>

<p>Reaching the northern point of the island,
a landing was made and a Chinaman landed,
armed with instructions from the viceroy&#8217;s
secretary to set fire to the grass in as many
places as possible and to return in time to be
picked up on the launch&#8217;s return.</p>

<p>The launch then steamed down stream,
stopping at several points to land the soldiers.</p>

<p>As yet, all was well. The launch had run
the complete length of the long island, landing
the incendiary soldiers; the south end of
the island was only a few hundred yards
ahead. Ta-Ling directed the foreign captain
to steer once more to the steep shore. There
were no more soldiers remaining; the ten men
had all been landed and ten fires were by
now burning fiercely in as many places on
the long island. Stepping ashore, he was soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
lost in the high grass towering over twenty
feet above him. Lighting a fire-brand, hastily
made of dry reeds, he carefully applied it, as
he walked along, to the dying vegetation.
Now in an hour the island would be a blazing
furnace. For the rest of the night the channels
would be lighted as bright as day. Even
the monitors would not dare to attempt to
pass the forts until the following night, and
by that time he would have fully revenged
himself on the Americans and escaped to the
interior. He smiled cruelly as his thoughts
dwelt upon his cunning ruse upon the viceroy;
the mandarin, in his excited fear, had
signed the order to Hang-Ki to withdraw his
soldiers from the mission to protect the forts.
Now the bloodthirsty rabble, armed and organized
by him (Ta-Ling), could with impunity
hurl themselves upon the mission.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br />


<small>RUNNING THE BATTERIES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> midshipmen gazed fearfully toward the
island. What could it mean? Had the grass
on the island been fired, and if so, would the
fire reach dangerous proportions before the
fleet had safely passed its shelter? What was
the meaning of the launch ahead of their
own?</p>

<p>Suddenly from a point on the far end of
the island a single flame of fire shot in the
air; the breeze caught it, helping it forward
on its career of destruction. Quickly at intermediate
points fires appeared to spring to life
out of the very ground. Then, as if to complete
the picture of failure in Phil&#8217;s mind, a
heavy reverberation shook the dry air and
the noise of a screeching shell came to his
ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the end,&#8221; gasped Phil as the search-light
from the fort appeared suddenly, as if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
the monstrous guns had been awakened from
a sound sleep and opened this one bright,
piercing eye.</p>

<p>The midshipmen were spellbound with fear
as they saw the beam of light sweep slowly
along the island, penetrating the thick grass.
For an instant, as the bright ray swept by, the
launch ahead stood out in bold outline.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ignacio&#8217;s launch!&#8221; Sydney exclaimed,
aghast. Then the enemy dissolved into the
night. The light moved over their own
launch and then step by step approached
the southern end of the island where, the
lads knew, was the column of advancing
gunboats.</p>

<p>An exclamation of relief escaped Phil as
he saw the beam of light stop and then sweep
back along the island. As yet, the gunboats
were undiscovered.</p>

<p>A terrible anxiety filled the lad&#8217;s mind.
By now Commander Hughes would know
the meaning of the numerous fires. Would
he turn back, believing the attempt to run
the forts would be a useless sacrifice? Here
was a situation from which there could be no
protection. The channel ran close to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
island; the grass was dry and burned like a
prairie fire. After the great bonfire had once
gained its head no living thing could remain
in the channel. In a half hour the fire would
have devoured the protecting screen and the
gunboats would be in the direct view of the
fort guns.</p>

<p>After the first alarm gun the forts had
become silent, but the lads watched the
search-light swing back toward the allied
fleet. Then Phil&#8217;s heart seemed to stop
beating, then beat faster for joy as the hull
of the &#8220;Ph&#339;nix&#8221; appeared, standing out
ghastly in the glow of the conflagration,
steaming boldly onward; the white surge
under the bow showed the effort Commander
Hughes was making to take his fleet as soon
as possible through the waters of the dangerous
channel. Then the lads saw the terrible
light sweep along the length of the following
column; deliberately it moved, revealing one
after another of the unprotected gunboats.</p>

<p>Then the sound of the fire so close at hand
was drowned by a sullen roar as the guns of
the forts hurled their great shells toward the
daring gunboats, hastening forward silently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
to put the flames of the burning island between
them and this irresistible menace.</p>

<p>&#8220;If they can get behind the fire before it
gets too hot they&#8217;ll be safe,&#8221; Phil cried clutching
Sydney&#8217;s arm in his excitement. &#8220;They
can&#8217;t see through the fire; even the search-light
will be useless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How many guns have you?&#8221; O&#8217;Neil asked
suddenly. The boatswain&#8217;s mate had in
silence steered after the launch ahead, urging
Emmons time and again to encourage his
men to speed the gasoline engine up to its
limit. &#8220;We can&#8217;t be no use to them gunboats,&#8221;
he added in explanation; &#8220;our job is
to catch the fellows that set this here island
on fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil withdrew his attention with difficulty
from the terrible one-sided battle raging
astern of them, to answer the sailor&#8217;s question.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are two stacks<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and a thousand
rounds of ammunition. Can we catch
them?&#8221; he questioned eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we can&#8217;t, we can stop &#8217;em with twelve
rifles,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil replied grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t dare fire on the launch,&#8221; Phil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
cried. &#8220;If we can overhaul them, that&#8217;s another
matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>The spectacle now revealed to those on the
launch was awe inspiring. The forts had
developed into a blaze of fire, while all about
the advancing gunboats shells struck incessantly.
The sides of the small vessels
had burst into flame as they fired their small
guns at the distant enemy. The high vegetation
on the island near them burned with
ever-increasing rapidity, the flames mounting
high in the air and lighting the surroundings
as bright as dawn.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Ph&#339;nix&#8221; now had entered the
channel, and with her battery silent cut
swiftly through the brightly lighted water.
The air was shaken by the noise of shell and
the shock of explosions.</p>

<p>The flame of fire from the burning island
formed a fiery veil, through which the eye
could not penetrate, but by the increased roar
of explosions and discharges, the lads felt
confident that the monitors were now engaging
the forts.</p>

<p>Another and even greater danger suddenly
confronted the allies. The breeze, which had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
been light, now had increased and was blowing
the suffocating smoke toward the channel.
In a short while as the fire gained headway
the channel would be enshrouded in thick
smoke through which it would be well-nigh
impossible to see. If by a fatal chance a gunboat
mistook the channel it would remain
hard and fast aground and in the morning
would be destroyed by the forts.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Ph&#339;nix&#8221; was now close aboard, a
wave under her forefoot showing her burst
of speed. The air every minute became
hotter and more stifling and those on the
launch without protection would soon suffer
from the scorching heat of the flames.</p>

<p>A line whistled over the launch, while
Commander Hughes&#8217; cool voice directed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Make it fast, and keep under our lee.
We&#8217;ll protect you from the heat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Quickly the tow-line was secured in the
bow of the launch and those on board the
smaller vessel were almost thrown from their
feet as the launch was dragged forward by the
tautening of the tow-rope.</p>

<p>Thicker and thicker, and more stifling, became
the smoke. The Americans wet their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
handkerchiefs, putting them over their mouths
to enable them to breathe.</p>

<p>Phil wondered how the following gunboats
were faring. The screech of shell was no
longer heard near them, but the reverberations
of discharges still smote upon their ears.</p>

<p>Then after what seemed hours of anxious
waiting they emerged into the clear night.
Filling their lungs with the pure air the lads
gazed about them. The island, a mass of
soaring flame, was behind them, and far away
on the port quarter they could see the stirring
spectacle of the monitors hotly engaging the
forts. The city of Ku-Ling had been passed;
the lights of the three anchored gunboats were
indistinctly visible in the darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the launch?&#8221; Sydney exclaimed,
gazing searchingly about him.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s back to the &#8216;Albaque&#8217; by this
time,&#8221; Phil replied disappointedly. &#8220;If we
could have only caught them red handed.
That means that Ta-Ling and Ignacio have
both been set free, for only they would set fire
to the island.&#8221;</p>

<p>Inside of ten minutes, Captain Hughes&#8217;
voice hailed them:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>&#8220;Let go the line. We are going to anchor.&#8221;</p>

<p>The line was quickly cast off and a
moment later, the lads were on the deck of
the gunboat, warmly congratulating their
captain upon his well-earned success.</p>

<p>&#8220;Signal the monitors to join us and be
ready to land their sailors,&#8221; the captain
ordered the signal officer, then turning to
Langdon, &#8220;We must take the chance from this
side. Perhaps we shall find the bridge intact.&#8221;</p>

<p>The allied gunboats one after another
dropped their anchors near the &#8220;Ph&#339;nix.&#8221;
As they passed the American vessel the crews
manned the rails with lusty cheers, which the
&#8220;Ph&#339;nix&#8217;s&#8221; crew returned with a will.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here they come,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed in
admiration as the two victorious and unharmed
monitors steamed swiftly toward their
flagship and anchored one on each quarter.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is to be only an American expedition,&#8221;
Commander Hughes declared to the
eager midshipmen. &#8220;Four hundred men all
told from the three ships.&#8221;</p>

<p>Quietly and without confusion the American
war-ships lowered their boats and embarked
their sailors. And inside of twenty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
minutes after anchoring the strong force had
started for the shore to push forward to the
relief of the mission.</p>

<p>Phil and Sydney remained with Commander
Hughes, who had elected to lead the
force in person.</p>

<p>As the boats grounded upon the sandy
shore the sailors noiselessly fell in ranks
under their officers. The American captain,
with Langdon as guide, took the lead, followed
closely by the two midshipmen with O&#8217;Neil
and a dozen men. The main force came along
a hundred yards behind them.</p>

<p>As yet all was silent. The forts had ceased
their fire, and no sound came from the
direction of the mission.</p>

<p>The force moved at a lively pace over the
rough ground. The sailors had been
cautioned to move noiselessly, and all loose
metal had been carefully muffled; everything
depended upon the possibility of surprise, or
else upon gaining admittance to the compound
of the mission before the enemy had
gathered to the attack.</p>

<p>Phil marched by Langdon&#8217;s side; his blood
warmed for adventure, and he hoped that this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
time he would be able to see and enjoy the
fighting. During the few minutes in the attack
on Lien-Chow, he had been so much occupied
in forcing Commander Ignacio to
charge the enemy that he had failed to take
note of all save the sound of the bullets as
they had whistled past him. He rejoiced in
the coolness and tact shown on all occasions
by his friend Langdon; his duty was not to
fight, yet he was ever eager to risk his life
wherever Commander Hughes suggested.</p>

<p>The Americans moved steadily onward,
Langdon time and again leaving the narrow
road to circle a small hamlet with its shading
willow trees in an endeavor to avoid the discovering
bark of the always-present Chinese
dog. Fortunately the countryside was deserted;
there were no travelers on the road to
flee and give warning of the approaching band
of hostiles.</p>

<p>As the distance to the mission diminished,
the sailors grasped their rifles more firmly, ever
expecting to hear the discharges and see the
flashes of the guns of an ambushing enemy.</p>

<p>While the expedition was ascending a small
hill covered with the graves of centuries of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
China&#8217;s dead, Langdon turned quietly to his
captain and pointed to an indistinct mass
coming in sight beyond the ridge ahead of
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;The mission,&#8221; he whispered; then he
stopped in his tracks, while those behind
pressed forward eagerly to know the cause.
The metallic bark of a Colt gun rang out
distantly on the quiet evening air, accompanied
by the duller rattle of musketry.
The mission was already being attacked.</p>

<small>TO THE RESCUE OF THE MISSION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ominous sound of strife sent shivers up
and down Phil&#8217;s spine; the mission was surrounded
by a force far in excess of the handful
guarding the helpless ones inside its wall; but
the droning sound of the Colt gun was reassuring;
it showed that Lieutenant Wilson had
been on the alert, and he knew that officer
well enough to believe that he would sacrifice
himself and every man with him before the
women and children were allowed to fall into
the hands of the cruel Chinese mob.</p>

<p>These thoughts flashed through Phil&#8217;s mind
while the sailors quickened their pace in
obedience to Commander Hughes&#8217; orders.</p>

<p>Reaching the crest of the hill, Phil gazed
with his companions through the darkness
down upon the valley between the mission
hill and the one on which they were standing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t deploy yet,&#8221; Langdon cautioned in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
a whisper to the American commander, who,
he observed, was on the point of forming
for the attack; &#8220;we must cross the bridge
over that irrigation ditch in the middle of the
valley; you can see the shadow of willows
along it from here. Once across that, all will
be clear ground between us and the mission.&#8221;</p>

<p>They pressed forward until the pilot raised
his hand warningly and Commander Hughes
signaled a halt. Langdon, motioning Phil to
accompany him, left the column and advanced
cautiously along the road toward the bridge,
concealed from their view by a group of
willow trees. Reaching the bridge, the pilot
examined carefully the bamboo structure,
then he gingerly placed his heavy foot on the
wooden planking, testing it with his great
weight of over two hundred pounds. Motioning
Phil to remain where he was, he then
walked cautiously across the bridge to test the
fastenings on the other side of the deep ditch.
The midshipmen saw his huge bulk dissolve
in the darkness, but in a few moments he
returned and his discovery was calculated to
bring despair to the stoutest heart. They
quickly joined the main body, waiting impatiently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
to push forward to the rescue of
their comrades.</p>

<p>&#8220;Many of the lashings are cut on the far
side, sir,&#8221; Langdon exclaimed in a low, excited
voice; &#8220;one or two men at a time can probably
cross in safety, but no more. There is no
other bridge for five miles, and that may be
in a similar condition.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here indeed was an effective stop to the
eager sailors in sight of the battle between
their comrades and the bloodthirsty enemy.
The volume of musketry fire directed upon
the mission had increased alarmingly, and at
frequent intervals came the roar of artillery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Breaching the wall or shelling the gate,&#8221;
Phil whispered in an awed voice as his eyes
caught the flash of a heavy explosion at the
base of the wall. His gaze, accustomed to
the darkness, traveled over the ground across
the ditch; it was strewn with high mounds,
graves of forgotten Chinamen, and the lad
saw that the natural protection offered excellent
cover for the sailors when once across
the shaky bridge structure; but, and a great
fear rose in his mind, it would also aid the
enemy in its endeavor to prevent the rescuers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
from crossing the nearly destroyed structure.
Were those mounds even now concealing a
large force of Chinese soldiers, who, when the
unwary foreigners had rushed upon the tottering
bridge, and many had fallen to the bottom
of the deep culvert fifty feet below, would open
fire upon their demoralized comrades, cut off
from further attempts to succor those inside
the mission compound?</p>

<p>The sailors advanced in silence to the edge
of the ditch, and then Commander Hughes,
grasping Langdon&#8217;s arm, stepped boldly upon
the treacherous planking, whispering to the
midshipman hurriedly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay on this side and send the men over
two at a time.&#8221;</p>

<p>As soon as the midshipman saw that his
captain and the pilot were safely on the other
side, he and Sydney silently selected two
sailors to follow; then in turn two more to
cross the intervening space. Slowly those on
the wrong side of the bridge decreased; Phil
could see that Commander Hughes had deployed
his men to protect the bridge in case
of a sudden attack, while he and Langdon at
the far side of the bridge were receiving and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
instructing the men after they had crossed
the swaying structure. Then without warning,
a flash of flame shot out into the night
from the direction of the Chinese graves, and
the screech of hostile bullets sounded loudly
about the foreigners. Phil, from his position,
saw the figures beyond the bridge seek refuge
behind a high mound, and then the reverberation
of the sailors&#8217; rifles told him that Commander
Hughes was returning the fire in the
hopes of protecting from the hot fire of the
enemy those still to cross the ditch.</p>

<p>The bridge was already swept by a hail of
lead; a groan from a man at his side told
him that unless they crossed quickly, there
would be but few remaining at all to cross
the tottering bamboo. He sent five men at a
time, watching fearfully until he saw them
disappear in the gloom; then six followed;
the bridge stood the weight, but swayed and
seemed on the point of falling. There were
now but four remaining, Sydney and two
men, one of whom lay sorely wounded on the
ground at his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go, Syd!&#8221; the lad exclaimed to his
brother midshipman. The lad shook his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
head, forcing the remaining sailor before
him; then by mutual consent he and Phil
lifted tenderly the wounded man.</p>

<p>Carefully they picked their way across the
bullet-swept, swaying structure. With their
burden, they reached the middle in safety;
Phil shuddered as his eyes took one fleeting
glance at the fall below him. Amid the noise
of strife, the tearing of the thongs, holding the
bridge on the far side, gave the two officers
no warning, and not until the floor tilted to
an unnerving angle did they see that they
must hasten if they would not be precipitated
to the bottom of the ditch. The wounded
man was a dead weight on their hands; Phil,
when he had felt the bridge sinking under
him, ran his hand nervously over the face
of the wounded sailor; the drooping jaw
told him that he had passed beyond mortal
aid.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s dead; save yourself!&#8221; he cried loudly
to his companion as he let fall his burden and
sprang forward.</p>

<p>By almost superhuman effort, side by side,
the whistle of the enemy&#8217;s bullets in their
ears, they threw themselves at the rising earth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
as their platform with increasing speed sank
beneath them.</p>

<p>Clutching at the crumbling earth, digging
their fingers deep into the rank grass, while
the bridge behind them fell with a great
crash into the stagnant and noisome water
fifty feet below, the two lads drew themselves
up, breathless but safe.</p>

<p>Phil quickly found Commander Hughes,
who had sought cover behind a mound
and was waiting until his men became
steadied before giving the order to advance.</p>

<p>Langdon threw his great arms about the
lads as they reached the protecting earth
mound, while the captain&#8217;s voice struck encouragingly
upon their ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Splendid!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was dead, sir,&#8221; Phil said sorrowfully.
&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t have saved his body and ourselves
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Silence lasted for several minutes, each reverencing
the visit of death.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must win now!&#8221; Commander Hughes
exclaimed grimly. &#8220;And we must repair that
bridge before we can return. But come; we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
must leave our cover and drive these Chinamen
from our path.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suiting his action to his words, he blew a
shrill blast from his whistle, the signal on
the skirmish line for &#8220;attention.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forward,&#8221; he commanded in a voice that
sounded loudly above the din of musketry.</p>

<p>The sailors sprang forward with enthusiasm;
the long wait under the fire of an unseen
enemy had bottled up their energy. Each
sailor&#8217;s foremost desire was to come to close
quarters with the treacherous Chinamen.
The long, slender line moved upward toward
the mission crest; the men taking cover as
they found it, and shooting when their keen
eyes discerned a shadowy form skulking
away before their advance into the darker
shadows.</p>

<p>The sharp rattle of the Colt guns told the
advancing men that the mission was stubbornly
resisting.</p>

<p>Phil moved incessantly along the advancing
skirmish line, carrying orders from his
captain to the flank companies; the alarming
song of the bullets ever in his ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Press forward, keeping the guide on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
center!&#8221; had been Commander Hughes&#8217;
simple instructions, and faithfully were they
being carried out by the determined men.
The mission loomed through the darkness
scarce five hundred yards distant; the tongues
of flame from its wall answered by cries of
rage and defiance from the enemy&#8217;s position
inspired the rescuing sailors to renewed exertions
to reach the protecting compound.
The Chinese who had opened fire upon the
Americans during the passage across the ill-fated
bridge had stolen away toward the
shadowy flanks; between the advancing
sailors and their objective there were now no
answering shots. Then suddenly the battery
which had been hurling shell at the stone
wall of the mission turned its fierce attention
upon the unprotected rescuers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seek cover!&#8221; Commander Hughes ordered;
and the men huddled together in
groups, thankful for the homes of the dead,
which furnished such perfect protection from
the well-directed fire of grape and canister
from the Chinese artillery, now giving its
undivided attention to the approaching re&euml;nforcements.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>Commander Hughes saw that a new danger
confronted the success of his undertaking;
those in the mission as yet could not know
of the close proximity of their friends, and
might they not in their vigorous defense turn
the muzzles of their Colt guns against them?
The thought was fearful to contemplate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Perry,&#8221; he ordered in a strained voice,
&#8220;those guns,&#8221; pointing to the hill on the
right from which long tongues of flame darted
momentarily, &#8220;must be silenced. We dare
not advance further under their murderous
fire. Take a hundred men and flank them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil gasped at the suddenness of the order,
thanking his captain in his heart for his confidence
in his ability to do what seemed to
the lad impossible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Langdon will show you the way,&#8221; Commander
Hughes ordered quickly; &#8220;don&#8217;t expose
your men to our own fire. I shall endeavor
to get word to the mission. Mr. Monroe
will remain with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>As silently as possible Phil selected those
to go with him, among them being his old
friend O&#8217;Neil, leading them on a run back toward
the ditch which had been crossed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
scarcely a quarter of an hour before; then he
gathered the men about him to explain the
dangerous work for which they had been
chosen.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall get on the flank of the artillery,
and when the order is given to advance we
must gain a position from which we can
charge directly upon the battery. The lives
of all depend upon our success.&#8221;</p>

<p>The men in silence accepted the conditions,
and in another minute Langdon was leading
the small band along the deep ditch in the
shadow of the bordering trees. After traversing
a few hundred yards the pilot paused
at a road crossing the one they were on.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the road we took the other night,&#8221;
Langdon whispered; &#8220;we shall follow it for
a short distance and then we shall be on the
flank and a little in rear of the Chinese
position.&#8221;</p>

<p>The command moved cautiously forward
until the pilot stopped and the midshipman
knew that the position desired had been
reached. Deploying his men quietly, he
bade them advance silently toward the
pandemonium of the Chinese attackers ahead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
of them. While he moved forward up the
gentle rise of the land he could see distinctly
the bright flashes from the enemy&#8217;s guns, but
his own men were as yet undiscovered and protected
by the intervening crest of the low hill
up which they were doggedly marching. He
glanced fearfully to his left to see how Commander
Hughes and his men were faring;
that part of the battle-ground was in darkness;
the Chinese seemed now too much
absorbed in their desire to destroy the mission
to give thought to the handful of sailors
known to have crossed the bridge before it
collapsed into the ditch below.</p>

<p>Steadily the flanking party advanced toward
the coveted position over the uneven
ground, the men casting apprehensive glances
to left and right, their rifles held ready for
instant conflict.</p>

<p>While Phil&#8217;s attention was absorbed by the
stirring sight ahead of him, against which he
would in but a few minutes launch his hundred
men in what seemed a forlorn hope, to
take and silence the formidable battery now
exerting itself to the utmost to breach the
wall of the compound, a terrifying danger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
loomed before him. The sailors in the compound
were delivering a murderous fire from
their Colt guns, directed at the troublesome
artillery, but many of the bullets were falling
alarmingly close to the flanking force. The
midshipman realized that he must go no
farther; with the battery scarce three hundred
yards in his front and his men as yet
undiscovered he must call a halt and remain
without that awful zone of fire until their
friends on the mission wall had been apprised
of his intentions by Commander
Hughes.</p>

<p>The word was passed quietly by word of
mouth along the line, and the sailors, keyed
to the highest pitch of excitement, threw
themselves face downward on the ground,
while less than a hundred yards ahead of
them a storm of bullets swept every inch of
the soil.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks black,&#8221; Langdon breathed in the
grass close to Phil&#8217;s ear as they both were
racked by ominous foreboding while watching
the sweep of the devastating stream of bullets;
&#8220;they haven&#8217;t got word to the mission yet
that we are here; if those guns are pointed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
ten degrees further this way, it will be all up
with us. See,&#8221; he added pointing in the
direction of the active artillery, &#8220;those guns
are behind intrenchments, for otherwise the
Chinese could not have stood such a murderous
fire for a minute. It&#8217;s withering,&#8221; he
gasped with a shudder, while the singing of
bullets redoubled, seeming to be slowly drawing
their deadly zone nearer to encompass the
crouching sailors.</p>

<p>Phil cast his anxious eyes often on the dark
slope of the mission hill where he had left the
main force under Commander Hughes, but the
night was too dark for him to discover what
was going forward. There was nothing for
him to do save wait with what patience he
could muster. To rush ahead could mean
but annihilation at the hands of his own
guns. He must not open fire upon the
battery, so close that the smell of burning
powder was rank in his nostrils; to do so
might draw the fire of the Colt guns, for how
could the mission know that help was so near
at hand?</p>

<p>After what seemed an eternity to the anxious
men, the fire of the Colt guns suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
ceased, while from the Chinese position, believing
no doubt that their enemy was weakening,
a great volume of musketry fire added
its roar to that of the big guns. Phil felt
the moment had come; the cessation of the
rhythmical discharges of the Colt guns must
be the result of communication between Commander
Hughes and those defending the compound.
He glanced anxiously through the
night toward the hidden enemy, while he was
at that moment framing the words which
would send his hundred men in a mad dash
against an intrenched foe, counting their
numbers by the thousands.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br />


<small>THE LAST CHARGE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> the order to charge trembling on his
lips, Phil hesitated. What did the silence
of the mission tell him? Had Commander
Hughes succeeded in gaining an entrance,
and had the mission ceased its fire by his
order to allow the midshipman&#8217;s party to
flank the battery so intent upon breaching
the wall through which the savage horde
would surge into the enclosure, butchering
every Christian found there?</p>

<p>He turned to O&#8217;Neil, lying quietly beside
him in the high grass. Through many adventures
the lad had become thoroughly convinced
of the sailor&#8217;s good and calm judgment.
He turned to him now, a grave fear in his
mind that precious moments were slipping
away, yet if he made a mistake and that
withering fire should again be loosened, all
would indeed be lost.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>&#8220;Are they waiting to allow us to advance?&#8221;
he whispered, half rising to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil cautioned; &#8220;if they know
we&#8217;re here they&#8217;ll signal. See!&#8221; he added,
his eyes fixed upon the mission.</p>

<p>Even as he spoke, a bright light flamed
suddenly above the wall, its appearance
awakening the enemy to renewed action.</p>

<p>Each of the hundred sailors turned his eyes
expectantly toward the mission. The light
burned brightly and then flickered regularly
and evenly for a few seconds, again burning
steadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right; signal!&#8221; Phil exclaimed,
straining his eyes to read the message which
he knew would be spelled out by that flashing
light.</p>

<p>Slowly, painfully the bright point of light
appeared and disappeared; all who knew the
navy code were reading, with muscles tense
and breath held tight, the encouraging words
flashing to them from across the intervening
darkness:</p>

<p>&#8220;We are holding our fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was small need to give the order to
charge; every sailor in that impatient line in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
but a moment knew that those in the mission
were waiting and trusting to them for
deliverance from the murderous fire of the
Chinese artillery.</p>

<p>The lad rose to his feet, grasping his revolver
firmly, and as one man the sailors
swept forward. Three hundred yards ahead
four pieces of modern artillery were battering
away at the concrete wall of the mission,
while dusky figures, believing their foe had
been silenced, swarmed boldly over the
grassy slopes behind and on either side
of the guns. So noiselessly did Phil&#8217;s men
advance that the enemy were even now
ignorant of the presence of a foe so near at
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we charge,&#8221; Langdon whispered
breathlessly, &#8220;order the men to yell; the
Chinese are as much afraid of noise as they
are of bullets.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil had always trained his men in their
drills to charge cheering. Now the time had
arrived; in the next hundred yards the men
would surely be exposed to the view and fire
of their enemy; concealment then would not
be an advantage; the Chinese should see and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
hear the danger in order to have it strike terror
to their hearts.</p>

<p>Raising his whistle to his lips, Phil blew a
shrill blast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Open fire!&#8221; he shouted at the top of his
lungs, &#8220;and charge, men, cheering!&#8221; he
added, raising his voice in an excited shout
as he sprang forward, leading the way toward
the now startled enemy.</p>

<p>The sailor line, an advancing sheet of flame,
charged straight for the crest of the hill in
front. The Chinese, occupied in their attack
on the mission, had never dreamed that the
small body of men believed to have crossed
the bridge would dare attack a position as
impregnable as theirs. Then out of the night,
without warning, what seemed to their superstitious
minds a thousand yelling demons
came as lightning towards them. If these
were the foreigners that had crossed the
bridge a miracle had been wrought and their
number increased a hundredfold; their
simple minds were ready to believe that the
despised foreign devils had taken wings and
flown across the unbridged ditch. An unreasonable
terror seized the surprised Orientals;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
some threw down their guns and deserted
precipitously, while others showed their
military training in turning gallantly and
firing fiercely at the rapidly approaching attackers;
some even made a vain effort to turn
the artillery in the direction of the unlooked-for
attack, but the charging Americans were
amongst them before a single gun could be
moved.</p>

<p>His revolver tightly gripped, Phil fired
blindly at the shadowy forms now but a few
yards from him; the bright flashes of his
shots revealing the terror in his victims&#8217; faces
as they gave way before him, and then
screaming with pain and an unconquerable
fear, melted into the night. Deafeningly in
his ears rang the discharges of both the pilot&#8217;s
and O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s revolvers, unerringly mowing
down those who dared stand in their path,
while on either side he saw his men fire volley
after volley into the mass of totally demoralized
Asiatics. Without leaders to stay them,
their wild terror had put wings to their feet,
and in but a few minutes the Americans found
themselves in undisputed possession of the fortified
position held so recently by their enemy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>Phil could hardly believe his eyes; he
glanced joyfully about him at the four guns
and his exultant men crowding into the
enemy&#8217;s deserted trenches. O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s cool
voice soon brought him to a realization of his
duty; his thoughts had been full of his easily-won
victory against such a formidable foe.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must hold this hill,&#8221; the sailor exclaimed;
&#8220;if the Chinese find out how few
men we have they&#8217;ll try to retake it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, O&#8217;Neil,&#8221; he answered
quickly; &#8220;but I must send word to Commander
Hughes. I&#8217;ll stay here while you,
Langdon, take a dozen men and give the captain
the news; he may have some new move
in mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Langdon readily agreed, and after a hand-clasp
with the midshipman, the pilot led his
handful of men back toward the main American
force.</p>

<p>After his friend had gone, Phil, with his
boatswain&#8217;s mate, looked carefully over the
situation. He saw with joy that the enemy
had left a great store of ammunition for the
artillery pieces, and that the guns were
similar to those his men used for drill on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
board ship. He started his men to work with a
will and in a few minutes they had turned
the guns&#8217; muzzles away from the mission and
directed them toward the line of the enemy&#8217;s
flight.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the very thing, sir,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil cried,
showing the midshipman a shell which he
recognized at once as canister; &#8220;they can&#8217;t
do much against us if we can find plenty of
that kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil immediately ordered a search, with the
result that nearly half of all the ammunition
boxes were found to contain these deadly
cartridges.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the survey been completed
when the Americans found themselves suddenly
subjected to a heavy musketry fire
from the direction taken by the fleeing
enemy; the lad could see distinctly shadowy
forms darting here and there from behind the
mound-like graves, and each moment the
figures drew closer and seemed bolder; Phil
realized that their enemy had been rallied in
its precipitous retreat by a trusted leader and
now the reassured Chinese were advancing
intent upon recapturing the guns which they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
had abandoned in their demoralized stampede.
A few of his men had already opened fire
upon the misty forms, but the lad saw at once
that the battery could not be saved by the
weak fire of less than a hundred rifles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cease firing!&#8221; he shouted above the increasing
din of battle. &#8220;To the guns, men;
load with canister!&#8221;</p>

<p>Obediently the sailors dropped their rifles
and took their stations at the four guns, the
leading men, petty officers, instructing those
under them as coolly as if they were but
drilling recruits on board ship. Phil heard
the metallic rasping of the shells as they were
loaded into the breeches of the guns and the
silvery ring of the breech plugs thrown
quickly shut. The guns&#8217; crews stood silently
ready, waiting for the word from their young
leader.</p>

<p>Controlling his excitement, the lad delayed
the expectant word to open fire; the Chinese,
in their eagerness to discredit the bravery of
their enemy, mistook the silence to mean that
the foreigners had retreated and came boldly
on, shouting their fanatical war-songs and exposing
their numbers to the view of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
Americans waiting to open upon them with
their own artillery. The sailors trained their
artillery pieces in silence, keeping the muzzles
pointed in the direction of the reckless horde
of delirious Chinamen.</p>

<p>Then swiftly at a word from the midshipman
the four guns in unison roared out a
challenge, leaving death and destruction in
the path of the hundreds of bullets fired at
once from the bores of the guns. Again the
reverberation shook the hilltop and again
the leaden hail poured into the now disordered
ranks of the advancing fanatics. As
rapidly as if the guns&#8217; crews were at target
practice, the four guns spoke, each time cutting
deep gaps in the enemy&#8217;s line. After a
feeble attempt to rally the disordered legions,
the Chinese leaders turned and fled, followed
by the already stampeded soldiers.</p>

<p>Having assured himself that this time the
enemy would not be likely to return, Phil
gave the order to cease firing and then turned
his eyes expectantly toward the mission, realizing
that its inmates had seen the attack
and were doubtless anxious of the final outcome.
However, in but a few minutes the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
signal-light appeared and flashed out a message
which showed the boy that his captain
had understood that he had gallantly repulsed
the sudden attack:</p>

<p>&#8220;Am coming to join you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Commander Hughes,
with a hundred more men at his back, stood
beside Phil in the enemy&#8217;s trenches; his captain
was unstinting in his praises, while Sydney,
who had accompanied him, hugged his
chum delightedly; Langdon stood by an
amused and pleased spectator.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve taught the enemy a lesson which
they will not soon forget,&#8221; the American
captain exclaimed, &#8220;and they will not be
likely to wish to try conclusions with us again
to-night, but at the same time we cannot afford
to treat the Chinese with too much scorn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil quickly explained the find of canister,
and the captain, much to O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s embarrassment,
called him up before the assembled
sailors and complimented him upon his ready
resource.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s men like you, O&#8217;Neil,&#8221; he said warmly,
&#8220;that make an expedition of this kind possible.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>O&#8217;Neil even in the darkness grinned sheepishly,
as if he had been discovered doing
something for which he ought to have been
ashamed.</p>

<p>Great was the rejoicing in the mission at
the unlooked-for deliverance, and upon Commander
Hughes&#8217; order the relieved non-combatants
quietly packed up their most treasured
belongings, ready to be conveyed through
the enemy&#8217;s country to the protection of the
war-ships.</p>

<p>It being found impossible to save the captured
guns, Phil, with O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s aid, deftly
dismantled the breech mechanisms and, securing
a heavy axe from the mission, rendered
quite useless the delicately fitting
parts, giving the sailors the damaged pieces
to carry to the ditch where they would be
thrown into the stagnant water at the bottom.</p>

<p>The missionaries, with tears in their eyes,
bid farewell to their home, expecting that
after the sailors had gone, the Chinese
would return and send up in smoke that
spacious monument to their earnest labors in
China. The party was obliged to make a wide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
detour to reach a bridge some miles from the
one crossed earlier in the night.</p>

<p>Dawn was breaking when the commander
led his victorious men with the rescued
missionaries safely to the bank of the river,
where small boats were waiting to transport
them to the protection of the American
war-ships. As the last of the refugees disembarked
at the gangway of the &#8220;Ph&#339;nix,&#8221;
the sun peeped out from behind the distant
hills.</p>

<p>Phil and Sydney longed for a few hours&#8217;
sleep, but they well knew that if they succumbed
to this desire they might miss altogether
what they felt would be the closing
scenes in the drama.</p>

<p>By signal, Commander Hughes at once
ordered that all non-combatants be sent on
board the gunboats, and that the monitors
hold themselves in readiness to get under way
within the hour.</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s hopes ran high as he and Sydney
made themselves presentable after their strenuous
night&#8217;s experience.</p>

<p>After a hasty breakfast the lads appeared
on deck. There they found their captain before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
them, gazing closely through his binoculars
at the distant forts.</p>

<p>At the gangway three cutters were lying,
and the landing force of the &#8220;Ph&#339;nix,&#8221; rifles
in hand, were standing in ranks ready to
embark.</p>

<p>&#8220;March the men into the boats, Wilson,&#8221;
Commander Hughes ordered suddenly, putting
his binoculars in their leather case. Then
as he turned to go below to his cabin, &#8220;Mr.
Perry, you and Mr. Monroe report to Mr.
Wilson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are we going?&#8221; Phil asked excitedly
as he saluted the lieutenant.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the &#8216;Monterey,&#8217;&#8221; Lieutenant Wilson
answered, &#8220;but that&#8217;s as far as I know. The
captain must expect hot work; each of my
men is ordered to take two hundred rounds of
ammunition.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to storm the walled city,&#8221;
Sydney exclaimed. &#8220;There&#8217;s no sign of submission
on either the forts or the viceroy&#8217;s
yamen. The captain means to rescue the four
sailors and carry out his threats upon Ku-Ling.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s pulses beat faster at the thought.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
Now war had been declared, and his captain
believed in striking promptly before his enemy
had time to gather his forces!</p>

<p>Quickly the sailors were embarked in the
waiting boats, and as Commander Hughes,
accompanied by Langdon, took his place in
the stern of the leading cutter, the oars were
thrust out through the rowlocks and the boats
pulled with swift strokes alongside the monitor,
anchored only a few hundred yards down
the river from the &#8220;Ph&#339;nix.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get under way, Barnes,&#8221; Commander
Hughes ordered as he stepped on board the
&#8220;Monterey,&#8221; &#8220;and signal the &#8216;Monadnock&#8217; to
follow us. Bend on the signal to her to
&#8216;clear ship for action&#8217;; the gunboats will
remain here out of range of the fort guns.&#8221;</p>

<p>The stirring call of the bugles sounded
with its nerve-tingling ring throughout the
ship, repeated in a few minutes by the
&#8220;Monadnock,&#8221; and with a cheer of delight the
crews disappeared below decks to their stations
for battle.</p>

<p>Inside of fifteen minutes all was in readiness,
and the heavy anchors were lifted from
the bottom of the river.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>With all the men not at gun stations behind
the thick armor of the small river battle-ships,
the &#8220;Monterey&#8221; gracefully turned
around close to the fleet of anchored gunboats.
Phil&#8217;s nerves were atingle as he heard the admiring
cheers of the allies float to them
across the water. Then the &#8220;Monterey,&#8221;
her huge turret guns loaded and ready to
open the battle, and followed closely by
her consort, steamed swiftly toward the hostile
forts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Break the battle flags,&#8221; Commander
Hughes ordered in his calm voice, standing
on the bridge beside the captain of the
&#8220;Monterey,&#8221; while Phil, Sydney and Langdon,
in the lee of the conning-tower, gazed,
consumed with excitement, upon the forts,
toward which the two big twelve-inch guns
were pointing. Phil saw on the flagstaff
at the top of the emplacement the proud
yellow banner of China, with its monster
dragon endeavoring to swallow a red ball,
just beyond the reach of its fiery nostrils.</p>

<p>&#8220;O&#8217;Neil is in the turret,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed
to Phil at his side. &#8220;He will fire one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
guns. I wonder if he can still shoot the way
he did at our record target practice when you
had the after turret.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s as steady as a rock,&#8221; Phil replied
enthusiastically. &#8220;I&#8217;ll wager that every one
of his shots will go true. He was the best
gun-pointer on the &#8216;Connecticut.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the range?&#8221; Commander Hughes
inquired, a shade of excitement creeping into
his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Three thousand yards, sir,&#8221; the officer at
the range-finder called out hoarsely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire one shot at the nearest gun emplacement,&#8221;
the American commander ordered the
&#8220;Monterey&#8217;s&#8221; captain, &#8220;and signal the &#8216;Monadnock&#8217;
to sheer up abreast us and when
the fort replies swing around and open with
her broadside.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil saw the alert signalmen swiftly signal
with their small hand flags the message to
their consort, and then immediately afterward
the &#8220;Monadnock,&#8221; which had been
steaming in the &#8220;Monterey&#8217;s&#8221; wake, swung
her bow in toward the city of Ku-Ling, which
the two vessels were rapidly passing. The
high wall was thronged with Chinamen;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
their curiosity having overcome their fear of
the terrible foreign war-ships.</p>

<p>The next second a heavy roar filled the air
and the forts disappeared completely from
view in the brownish vapor from the turret
gun.</p>

<p>Grasping the rail tightly in his excitement,
his heart beating like a trip-hammer, Phil
gazed through the quickly dissolving smoke.
The sonorous screech of the shell in his ears,
he strained his eyes to pick up the huge
projectile, travelling nearly a half a mile a
second toward the hostile fort.</p>

<p>Grasping the binoculars from Langdon&#8217;s
hand, he raised them swiftly to his eyes. A
black dot appeared, upon which the lad
focused his attention, as if to lose it might
mean a miss. He saw the bird-like bolt rise
high above the white stone emplacements,
and knew on the instant, from his long experience
watching just such shells at the
peaceful drill of target practice, that the messenger
of destruction, filled with an explosive
that would scatter death and consternation in
its path, would go true to its aim.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right on top of the emplacement!&#8221; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
shouted excitedly a half second before a
liquid fire flashed on the parapet of the forts,
while tons of earth and rock were scattered in
every direction.</p>

<small>THE FORTS SURRENDER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> Phil had been gazing spellbound
at the half ton shell, fired by O&#8217;Neil with
such startling effect, Sydney was watching
excitedly a small squad of Chinese soldiers
toiling painfully upward from the gun emplacements.</p>

<p>When the roar of discharge shook the air
he had seen these small black figures throw
themselves behind the jutting rocks, and
after the missile had exploded upon the
parapets of the forts, hurling by its tremendous
force a large gun backward from its
substantial mountings, these persistent dots of
men again appeared to view, creeping steadily
upward. What did it mean? Were these
men deserting their guns?</p>

<p>Sydney heard his captain give the order to
reload, and knew that within the minute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
another shell would be speeding toward the
enemy. The foremost Chinaman had now
reached the foot of the great flagstaff, and the
next second, to the lad&#8217;s delight, he saw the
yellow banner flutter slowly to the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are striking their colors,&#8221; he cried
excitedly.</p>

<p>All eyes turned in glad surprise toward the
flagstaff to the right of and above the gun
emplacements.</p>

<p>&#8220;A white flag!&#8221; Phil gasped, a tinge of disappointment
in his voice, as he saw the banner
of submission mount the flagpole quickly.
Now all was over, and he had seen but one
shot fired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cease firing!&#8221; Commander Hughes
hastily ordered, fearing that the next shot
might, with the white flag displayed on the
forts, cause the Chinese to think that the
monitor had intentionally disregarded the
sanctity of the emblem, thus precipitating an
engagement with the forts which the American
officer was only too glad to avoid.</p>

<p>The bugles sounded the retreat from firing,
and disappointed faces soon appeared from
the turrets, to gaze out upon the unwelcome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
white flag flaunting in the light morning
breeze.</p>

<p>&#8220;Follow us,&#8221; had been the signal to the
&#8220;Monadnock,&#8221; and the two victorious vessels,
in column, made a graceful turn and then
steamed up stream toward the renegade gunboats
anchored off Ku-Ling.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does it mean?&#8221; Phil breathed excitedly
to Langdon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something has happened,&#8221; Langdon exclaimed,
shaking his head in mystery.</p>

<p>&#8220;The viceroy&#8217;s now going to send a flag of
truce to us,&#8221; Sydney suggested; &#8220;and I hope
Ta-Ling comes with it. I&#8217;d certainly like to
see Phil hand him back the pigtail he borrowed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despite the seriousness of the situation all
laughed at the thought of the discomfited
Chinaman without his cue.</p>

<p>The ships were now passing close to the
&#8220;Albaque&#8221;; the sailors of that gunboat
watched the American monitors in sullen
silence. The midshipmen looked in vain for
Commander Ignacio; he was not on deck.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s ready to get under way,&#8221; Phil exclaimed,
pointing to that vessel. &#8220;See! her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
anchor gear is rove off and her steam launch
has been hoisted inboard.&#8221; Sure signs indeed
that the gunboat was ready to move.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Monterey&#8221; slowly steamed by the
renegades until the gate of the city came in
view from the river; then a rattle of chain
announced that the war-ship had anchored.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Monadnock&#8221; had by order stopped
astern and upon signal dropped her anchor,
so that in case of treachery that monitor&#8217;s
big guns could be readily trained on the
forts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Barnes,&#8221; Commander Hughes said
with energy, &#8220;call away the landing force
and set them ashore.&#8221; Then he drew Lieutenant
Wilson aside, talking earnestly with
him for some minutes.</p>

<p>Inside of another ten minutes the midshipmen
found themselves on the jetty of the
foreign concession, while in ranks along the
water front, their rifles at the shoulder, stood
three hundred stalwart sailors from the three
American ships.</p>

<p>Phil glanced uneasily toward the high city
wall. The gate he could not see, but he knew
it was closed and the drawbridge raised.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
Probably the Chinamen he had seen on the
wall when the monitors steamed down the
river were now peering out through the hundreds
of loopholes, their rifles ready to defend
their city from the foreign invader, for the
lad knew that Lieutenant Wilson&#8217;s orders had
been to rescue the sailors in the yamen.</p>

<p>&#8220;How shall we cross the moat?&#8221; he faltered
to Langdon at his side.</p>

<p>The question remained unanswered, for the
next moment a heavy discharge rent the still
air, followed by an explosion near the city
wall. Again came the shock of firing and
Phil saw that the &#8220;Monterey&#8217;s&#8221; big guns had
been fired at the main gateway of the city.</p>

<p>Shell after shell sped quickly toward the
gateway, scarcely five hundred yards from the
monitor&#8217;s guns.</p>

<p>The lads gazed about them in bewilderment.
How could this aid them? Then the
firing ceased and a flag waved rapidly from
the war-ship.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fours right,&#8221; Lieutenant Wilson cried excitedly,
hastily leading the column to the
cross street up which the monitor had fired.
Arriving there, Phil gasped with admiration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
at the havoc wrought by the big shells. The
drawbridge was down across the moat and the
great gate of wood and iron had been literally
torn from its huge hinges and thrown bodily
fifty feet within the city.</p>

<p>In silence the sailors were led across the
drawbridge, Phil noticing the severed chains
which had allowed the bridge to fall in place,
and then they were inside the city.</p>

<p>No signs of life were visible, and the open
doors and windows of the houses showed
plainly that the Chinese had departed suddenly,
fearing the shells of the foreigners.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the yamen, Langdon,&#8221; Lieutenant
Wilson cried eagerly. Then as the pilot
pointed out the direction: &#8220;Fix bayonets!&#8221;
The rasping of the three hundred bayonets as
they were adjusted on the rifles lasted for
half a minute and then Lieutenant Wilson
added sharply, &#8220;Forward, double time.&#8221;</p>

<p>At a run the rescuing column swept along
the narrow street.</p>

<p>Phil and Sydney eagerly raced ahead, followed
closely by the lieutenant and Langdon.
After but a few minutes the midshipmen
reached the gateway of the yamen.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>An exclamation of grave concern from
Sydney caused his companions to cast anxious
glances toward the expansive parade
grounds in front of the yamen gate. The
sight that met their eyes was indeed disconcerting.
They had expected no more than
feeble resistance, but there before them, drawn
up as if on parade, was a vast army of Chinese
soldiers.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the meaning of this?&#8221; Lieutenant
Wilson asked falteringly, coming to a sudden
stop, while his men gazed in wonder at the
thousands of well-armed soldiers, apparently
in battle array, awaiting the word to begin the
fight.</p>

<p>&#8220;It means that viceroy Chang-Li-Hun has
overshot his bolt,&#8221; Langdon returned joyfully;
&#8220;these men are of another province. Do you
see their yellow plumes? The viceroy&#8217;s
soldiers wear red.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sent by Peking,&#8221; he added. &#8220;It means
the viceroy is to be brought to account by his
government.&#8221;</p>

<p>While Langdon was speaking, a horseman
rode rapidly toward the Americans. Langdon
walked out quickly to meet him when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
drew rein at the edge of the roadway,
and immediately addressed him in his own
language.</p>

<p>Then, after a few moments&#8217; rapid talk, he
turned to the lieutenant, a broad smile on his
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as I supposed. They are here to
suppress outlaws. His general has gone to
the forts to confer with Hang-Ki. He says
the viceroy has refused to receive him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell him,&#8221; Lieutenant Wilson said hurriedly,
&#8220;that four of our sailors are held
prisoners in the yamen, and that I am going
to enter by force if they refuse to open the
gate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He says his men will not interfere,&#8221; the
pilot returned, after a few hurried words with
the Chinese officer. &#8220;In fact, I believe
they&#8217;d gladly help us. This viceroy is not
popular with the Manchus.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without more ado Lieutenant Wilson
knocked loudly on the gate with the butt of
his revolver. There followed a whispered
consultation from beyond the gate and then a
small slit slid back suddenly, revealing a pair
of almond eyes, peering out suspiciously.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>Before Langdon could speak, the Chinese
officer had dismounted from his Tartar pony,
and held the owner of the eyes in earnest
conversation. A moment later the slit was
closed sharply, and the officer recoiled angrily,
muttering invectives at the rudeness of his
rebuff.</p>

<p>&#8220;He says, break in the gate,&#8221; the pilot
laughed in amusement.</p>

<p>Anticipating this move, Sydney had led a
party of men to where a telegraph pole was
lying on the ground, ready to replace a pole
apparently condemned.</p>

<p>&#8220;It couldn&#8217;t have been handier,&#8221; he exclaimed,
as the men lifting it moved it in
position to batter in the gateway.</p>

<p>A few forceful blows, and the American
sailors poured through the shattered gates.</p>

<p>Another gateway barred further progress,
and this was soon sent flying to pieces and
the foreigners found themselves within the
main courtyard of the viceroy&#8217;s palace.
Never before had foreign sailors entered these
sacred precincts with hostile intent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Perry, you and Mr. Monroe press
ahead,&#8221; Lieutenant Wilson ordered. &#8220;You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
know something of the yamen,&#8221; he added, a
faint smile on his earnest face. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be
rash,&#8221; he warned. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be on hand if you
need aid, but it looks as if the yamen were deserted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Quickly selecting a dozen men, among
whom was O&#8217;Neil, who had pressed forward
to the midshipmen&#8217;s side upon entering the
building, Phil led the way toward the
viceroy&#8217;s private apartments.</p>

<p>The door through which they had entered
the night before was bolted from within, but
by the united weight of Langdon and O&#8217;Neil
it soon opened obediently. They found this
room empty, but the door to the viceroy&#8217;s bedroom
was open slightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Careful, Mr. Perry,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil cried, catching
the lad&#8217;s arm and drawing him back from the
open door.</p>

<p>The boatswain&#8217;s mate was just in the nick
of time. A rifle muzzle had suddenly been
thrust through the opening and discharged,
filling the room with the noise of thunder.
Phil recoiled in terror, his face burning painfully
from the heat of the discharge, while
his ears were deafened.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>&#8220;Do you see, sir?&#8221; O&#8217;Neil observed huskily,
as he wrenched the rifle from the Chinaman&#8217;s
hand and clubbed him into insensibility before
he could run. &#8220;Always approach an
open door with caution and from the side.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crowding into the viceroy&#8217;s bedchamber,
the Americans were struck dumb by the sadness
of the spectacle before them.</p>

<p>There in the great canopied bed lay the
form of the aged viceroy; his eyes were
closed, while upon his parchment-like face
had spread the pallor of death. The room
was empty save for a single figure standing
beside the bed, a look of mortal fear in his
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dead!&#8221; Phil whispered in awe at the
sight, while he reverently removed his cap.
The sailors stood in silence, their heads uncovered,
thrilled by the scene. Chang-Li-Hun&#8217;s
face, even in death, had not lost its
cruel expression. He lay there, silent, unconquered.
The will of Peking held no terrors
for him now.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_342.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><i>THE AMERICANS WERE<br />
STRUCK DUMB</i></p>

<p>Langdon motioned to the Chinaman at the
dead man&#8217;s bedside that no harm would come
to him, and after gaining courage, but eyeing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
fearfully the insensible body of the last remaining
guard, he came slowly to the pilot&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>&#8220;He says Ta-Ling has not returned,&#8221;
Langdon breathed in a subdued voice after a
minute&#8217;s talk with the frightened man. &#8220;He&#8217;s
the treasurer you choked in the next room,&#8221;
he continued hurriedly to Phil, &#8220;and he will
lead us to the cell where the sailors were confined.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lad&#8217;s hopes ran high. If Ta-Ling had
not returned, it might be possible that the
men were as yet alive.</p>

<p>As the Americans hastened after the Chinaman,
they passed Lieutenant Wilson and his
waiting sailors in the courtyard.</p>

<p>&#8220;The viceroy is dead!&#8221; Phil exclaimed
hurriedly as he passed him.</p>

<p>The treasurer led the way past the cell in
which the midshipmen had spent so many
horrible hours of torture, but to Phil&#8217;s alarm
it was now empty.</p>

<p>&#8220;The prisoners are gone,&#8221; the lad faltered,
pointing to the deserted prison. &#8220;Ask him
the meaning, Langdon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He says he knows nothing,&#8221; the pilot
replied after stopping suddenly and questioning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
the distracted Chinaman. &#8220;He has been
with the viceroy all night. Upon hearing of
the arrival of the troops sent by Peking, the
viceroy swallowed poison, a deadly Chinese
drug, which he always carried with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Moving rapidly onward the Chinaman
stopped suddenly in front of a cell door.</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s heart was as lead as he pushed the
door open. The cell was empty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ta-Ling did return,&#8221; he cried in despair.</p>

<small>PHIL EXPLAINS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O&#8217;Neil</span>, with his characteristic energy,
wasted no time upon the cell, which he had
made up his mind long since would be found
empty, but with three or four sailors at his
back had pressed forward to the end of the
narrow corridor.</p>

<p>He heard Phil&#8217;s cry of disappointment as
he found himself on the edge of a smaller
courtyard, and was just in time to discover
a fleeing band of Chinamen disappearing
through a narrow alley at the far end.</p>

<p>Calling loudly for the others to follow, the
boatswain&#8217;s mate ran hurriedly forward across
the stone-paved court.</p>

<p>Reaching the entrance to the alley, the
sharp discharges of rifles from the other end
caused him to stop abruptly, but before he
could gain a place of safety, a stinging pain
in his shoulder made him cry out sharply.</p>

<p>Then his anger overcame his training in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>
discretion and with his men beside him,
while the heavy footfalls of the midshipmen
advancing on a run across the courtyard told
him of the approach of re&euml;nforcements, he
boldly raced between the bordering walls of
brick and mortar now swept by the enemy&#8217;s
bullets.</p>

<p>As he again emerged into the sunlight, he
was barely in time to see the persistent enemy
scattering like a covey of partridges through
numerous passages at the far end of a third
courtyard, while from that direction a hot
fire was directed upon him and his handful of
men.</p>

<p>What should he do? He could advance no
further in the face of that rifle fire. Glancing
anxiously behind him, he saw the midshipmen
and their men were nowhere in view,
and yet they had been only a half hundred
paces behind when he had charged down the
alley. The sailors were returning the furious
fire of the Chinese, but O&#8217;Neil saw that the
enemy was hidden and the spatter of their
bullets against the wall behind the Americans
showed him only too plainly that even the
poor shots of the Chinese might accidentally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
make a hit. Reluctantly he ordered a retreat
back through the arched passageway.</p>

<p>As O&#8217;Neil and his men again reached the
second courtyard, across which he had chased
the fleeing Chinamen, he saw the midshipmen
and their party surrounding several
objects upon the ground, which had been
covered over with a large piece of canvas.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are safe,&#8221; Sydney&#8217;s voice hailed as
he caught sight of the returning sailors.
&#8220;You ran right over them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The prisoners were quickly freed from their
manacles, and, supported by their comrades,
the party hastened to rejoin Lieutenant Wilson.</p>

<p>The four sailors had had a narrow escape.
Ta-Ling, determined upon revenge, had been
upon the point of beheading them when
O&#8217;Neil and his men had caused him to desist.
Then covering them hurriedly with a large
piece of canvas, he hoped to conceal their
presence until the Americans had given up
their search, when he would return and
finish his diabolical work. But the curiosity
of an American had defeated his plan; for
raising the corner of the canvas the sailor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
had seen the blue-clad legs of a bound and
gagged shipmate.</p>

<p>Arriving in the main courtyard, Phil&#8217;s
eye caught the bright color of a Chinese
mandarin&#8217;s clothes, their wearer standing at
Lieutenant Wilson&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hang-Ki!&#8221; he exclaimed joyfully as he
recognized the Tartar general&#8217;s erect form.</p>

<p>The two midshipmen hastened to the
Manchu&#8217;s side and shook hands with him
warmly.</p>

<p>Hang-Ki had been patiently waiting for
Langdon&#8217;s return to interpret his words to
the American lieutenant. Another mandarin
stood by Hang-Ki&#8217;s side, his rugged frame indicating
clearly that he also was of Tartar
blood, from which race the military leaders
of China are taken.</p>

<p>The midshipmen waited impatiently to
hear what Hang-Ki had to tell, while Lieutenant
Wilson congratulated all hands upon
the success of the rescue, and shook hands as
all had done with the rescued men.</p>

<p>&#8220;His Excellency says the viceroy killed
himself early this morning; the captain of
the yamen guards brought him the news, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
it did not arrive in time to hoist the white
flag before the monitor had fired her shell.
He says many men were hurt during the
night engagement and asks how many
Americans were killed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell him we&#8217;ve lost only one man in all
the fighting,&#8221; Lieutenant Wilson replied.</p>

<p>Hang-Ki, after Langdon had given him
Lieutenant Wilson&#8217;s words, shook his head
as though mystified.</p>

<p>The two generals expressed a wish to visit
the American commander, and make China&#8217;s
peace for the hostile acts of the dead viceroy.</p>

<p>The sailors were assembled and marched
directly to the landing.</p>

<p>As the river and the anchored ships came
into view, Phil grasped Sydney&#8217;s arm excitedly,
pointing to a white yacht lying gracefully
at anchor between the monitors and the
&#8220;Ph&#339;nix&#8221;; the latter having left the allies
at the upper anchorage and steamed down the
river while they were inside the Chinese city.</p>

<p>&#8220;The &#8216;Alacrity&#8217;!&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;and the
admiral&#8217;s on board; there&#8217;s his flag at the
main,&#8221; pointing to a large blue flag, with two
white stars in the field. Then the joy died<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
in his face. The letter of the viceroy and the
telegram, as yet undelivered, came to his
mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the &#8216;Albaque&#8217;?&#8221; Sydney asked
suddenly, searching the river for Ignacio&#8217;s
ship.</p>

<p>&#8220;There she goes,&#8221; Langdon cried, pointing
down stream, where a trail of smoke from a fast
disappearing steamer hung low over the muddy
water of the river.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the &#8220;Ph&#339;nix,&#8221; there was
Commander Hughes on deck, anxiously waiting
to hear the results of the expedition. His
face was wreathed in smiles as he heard of
their unlooked-for success. Then, motioning
Langdon to follow, he led the two Chinese
officers to his cabin.</p>

<p>Phil had not dared, with his guilt written
plainly on his face, to look his captain in the
eye while that officer showered praises upon
the two midshipmen, and he was much relieved
to be able to escape to his own room,
there to map out a course of action.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our best plan, Syd,&#8221; Phil declared, &#8220;is to
take all these papers to the captain and make
a clean breast of it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>Sydney agreed wholly with his friend&#8217;s
plan and all that remained was to muster up
courage to go to the captain. Both midshipmen
would much rather have faced a hundred
Chinese rifles than confess to their captain
that a telegram and directed to him from the
navy department had been purposely hidden.</p>

<p>A rap on the door caused Phil&#8217;s pulses to
beat quicker and his heart rise to his mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;The captain would like to see Mr. Perry
and Mr. Monroe,&#8221; the orderly announced,
peering in through the curtain at the startled
lads.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, Phil,&#8221; Sydney urged; &#8220;we&#8217;d
better get it over with.&#8221;</p>

<p>In silence they walked into the cabin.
Phil&#8217;s head swam as his old friend Admiral
Taylor shook his hand and spoke solid words
of praise for his valuable services.</p>

<p>Hang-Ki had risen to go upon the entrance
of the midshipmen, and after bowing to the
admiral and captain he stepped quickly to
Phil&#8217;s side, pressing into his hand the jade ring.</p>

<p>&#8220;He says,&#8221; Langdon interpreted, &#8220;that he
has evidence enough without it if he is lucky
enough to capture Ta-Ling.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>&#8220;I am delighted, Hughes,&#8221; the admiral
said as Commander Hughes returned with
the midshipmen, after having escorted the
Chinese soldiers to the gangway, &#8220;at the successful
end gained by your clear-headed
policy. Washington, hearing nothing from
you and at the same time receiving news of
your doings from a foreign government, was
quite justified, in view of your known impetuosity,
in being anxious. It was current
in Shanghai that you had been relieved of
your command, yet I received no word up to
the time of sailing, two days ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil saw his opportunity had come to bare
his secret, and drawing the viceroy&#8217;s letter,
the telegram and the correspondence of
Ignacio all from his pocket, he laid them in
silence on the table between the two officers.</p>

<p>The lads waited in a fever of dread while
the officers glanced in surprise at the papers
before them. Phil saw that the admiral held
the cipher telegram, with the translation underneath
the cipher words.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does this mean?&#8221; the admiral cried
sternly, reading aloud the translation of the
cablegram.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>Phil boldly told where and when he had
found the telegram, and his reasons for not
delivering it until now.</p>

<p>The admiral regarded the lad severely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Knowing this was from the department
in Washington, you concealed it,&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;Explain yourself, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil swallowed hard and then pointed a
trembling finger to the other papers.</p>

<p>&#8220;After you have read those, sir,&#8221; he said
huskily, &#8220;I shall be ready to stand guilty or
not guilty in your eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both officers eagerly read the letters from
Ignacio to the viceroy&#8217;s secretary.</p>

<p>After the admiral had finished reading, he
regarded Phil in silence, his expression
fathomless to the anxious midshipman.
Commander Hughes&#8217; eyes gave him no encouragement;
they were directed to his
brightly polished shoes. It was a question
between the senior midshipman and his commander-in-chief.
Technically a great breach
of naval discipline had been committed.</p>

<p>The minutes ticked away slowly by the
cabin clock while the lad waited for the wording
of his doom.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>&#8220;Mr. Perry,&#8221; the admiral at length began
in his usual calm voice, &#8220;this is the second
time that you have placed me in a most embarrassing
position, but I want to say right
here,&#8221; and his eyes snapped, &#8220;if I had a
son, and he had committed this breach of
naval discipline in order to save the situation,
I would be mighty proud of him.&#8221; As he
finished he put out his hand to the surprised
but happy midshipman, who grasped it joyfully.</p>

<p>Phil was so surprised that he could not
find voice to utter a single word. He stared
dumbly at the admiral, his tear-dimmed eyes
eloquently speaking the words he could not
utter.</p>

<p>Commander Hughes jumped up and grasped
the midshipman by the hand, showing in his
face the keen pleasure the admiral&#8217;s decision
had given him.</p>

<p>&#8220;This correspondence I shall keep in my
safe,&#8221; the admiral said, a twinkle in his eyes,
&#8220;in case I have trouble in explaining our
young friend&#8217;s crime. It may also serve
us in the future with this foreign Judas
Iscariot.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>&#8220;And now, young man,&#8221; he added, his kind
face beaming with good nature, &#8220;I think
after a few months I shall have to deprive
your captain of your services. I am going to
put in commission a number of small gunboats
for duty against the Philippine insurgents,
and I have decided to give Mr.
Perry command of one of them with Mr.
Monroe as his executive officer, and I suppose,&#8221;
he suggested with a smile, &#8220;that you
will want O&#8217;Neil as the chief boatswain&#8217;s
mate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil could hardly believe his ears. Instead
of censure, here was the admiral offering him
a ship of his own.</p>

<p>As one in a dream he thanked the admiral
and accompanied by Sydney, withdrew from
the cabin.</p>

<p>By order of Peking Hang-Ki was made
viceroy and he at once took steps to safeguard
all foreigners throughout the provinces.</p>

<p>The allied gunboats within the hour
anchored off Ku-Ling, and before the day
was over the foreign concession had taken up
the thread of business where it had been so
rudely interrupted. Commander Hughes detailed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
a force of mechanics from the American
war-ships to repair the damaged launches
of the faithful Emmons, and before a week
had passed the launch trade was flourishing
as of old.</p>

<p>The concession to build the railroad to
Peking was made more secure to the American
company, and before the &#8220;Ph&#339;nix&#8221; sailed
for Shanghai the lads saw the material, which
had long waited for permission to be landed,
safely stored in go-downs and the work on the
road started.</p>

<p>Ta-Ling made good his escape, and it was
believed that he had gone to the mountains,
there to remain in hiding until another opportunity
might present itself to avenge himself
on the despised foreigner.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s wound was found by the doctors to
be not dangerous and, with his arm in a sling
for several days, he was gazed at admiringly
by his less fortunate shipmates.</p>

<p>Langdon received the personal thanks of
the admiral, and Commander Hughes stoutly
declares that he is as good a pilot ashore as
he is on the river.</p>

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
